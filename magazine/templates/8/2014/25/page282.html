<h2>Has PV success pushed renewables too fast?</h2> <p>A push for renewable energy sources is not a new quest for our species but the speed of change in the last decade or so seems to have caught the traditional energy suppliers off guard and around the world we are seeing changes that suggest there is a bit of a backlash to renewable energy sources, and in particular, solar energy.</p><p>Of course such changes on a global scale are not easy to define and it would be difficult to show any links to some of the changes and the companies that most benefit from the changes. On a local scale it would seem obvious that some regions are reacting to such growth but in others the backlash is more subtle.</p><p>We are seeing CEOs of major solar companies telling the world of the naivety of believing solar could ever surpass the knowledgeable and incumbent energy giants’ ability to manage national grids. Or, heaven forbid, ever replace the need for nationally controlled energy sources.</p><p>We are seeing many regions changing or cutting financial support to renewable energy expansion with costs cited as the primary reason. While it is true that PV costs have dramatically reduced over time, the subsidy reviews often contain subtle changes that impact the industry. In the UK for example, the government has ensured PV must now compete with other renewable sources for state supports, conveniently reducing the overall pot at the same time.</p><p>Meanwhile China continues to grow in a manner that still seems to surprise traditional money markets. Analysts are predicting the country to hit 100GW in a couple of years and this year China expanded its GDP while reducing the amount of coal used, demonstrating its renewable commitment. In a global enery market these positive energy figures have a ripple effect that can impact on other regions.</p><p>Australia has been moving towards becoming a global leader in renewable capacity with over 2 million homes covered and some regions passing 50% in renewable generation. The new governement decided to review the country’s much-lauded Renewable Energy Target (RET) policy from the previous government.</p><p>They decide to put a traditional energy man in charge of the review and suddenly China’s impact became obvious in a country which is a huge resource exporter with China the biggest coal customer. To the surprise of many in the energy sector the review directed Australia to cut the RET and to increase the purchase of coal. The government is seriously considering this option.</p><p>Despite the idealistic beginnings of the industry that solar would provide free energy to the world the truth is that energy is big business nowadays. Solar has grown faster than expected and pushed renewable options to the forefront of the business sector which will look at ways to integrate the changes into their own battle plans.&nbsp;</p><p>With the financial markets controlling more of the renewable sector, financial returns will be more important than social energy goals and ideals. If the foundation that companies and individuals began with is ever to continue then stake holders in renewable energy will need to be more involved in the broader energy discussion or face being lost in the bigger picture.</p>
