This is especially true for board-to-board and chip-to-chip data transfer, where higher bandwidth interconnects are mandatory.</p> <p>Optical communication, which is well established for the long haul, and metro networks enable greater bandwidth to overcome the limitations of electrical interconnects.&nbsp; During the last decade, tremendous progress had been made in integrating the needed active and passive elements into a single chip.&nbsp; Currently, all optical functions except for the light source can be embedded on the wafer-level using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates.&nbsp; Thus, heterogeneous integration of compound semiconductor materials is crucial to implementing the light source on the optical chip. </p> <p>&nbsp;On-chip integration of different material platforms is highly challenging due to issues with lattice parameter, thermal expansion co-efﬁcient, and crystal structure mismatches.&nbsp; Thus, finding solutions to enable the fusion of different functionalities and semiconductor materials onto a single chip remains a central topic of engineered substrates.&nbsp; Direct wafer bonding is an enabling technology for heterogeneous integration by separating optimized epitaxial growth with layer integration via bonding. This has enabled the realization of data rates up to 100 GB/s, which will impact the market soon.&nbsp;</p>
