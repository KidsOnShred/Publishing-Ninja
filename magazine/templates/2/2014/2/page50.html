<p>Craic Technologies, an innovator of UV-visible-NIR microanalysis solutions, is introducing Craic FilmPro film thickness measurement software. </p> <p>This software package is designed to plug-in to Craic Technologyâ€™s microspectrophotometers and their controlling Lambdafire software.&nbsp; Craic FilmPro allows the user to measure the thickness of thin films rapidly and non-destructively. </p><p>Able to analyse films of many materials on both transparent and opaque substrates, Craic FilmPro enables the user to determine thin film thickness on everything from semiconductors, MEMS devices, disk drives to flat panel displays. The software can be used in many different fields and in everything from research to industrial settings.</p><p><b>[Image Needed]</b></p><p>"Many of our customers want to measure the thickness of thin films of smaller and smaller sampling areas for rapid quality control of their products. Craic FilmPro is a plug-in module that can be added to a Craic Technologies microspectrophotometer to enable this capability. This software was built in response to customer requests for a powerful, flexible film thickness tool that can measure sub-micron areas on both transparent and opaque substrates.Craic Technologies microspectrophotometers equipped with Craic FilmPro meets those needs" says Paul Martin, President.</p><p>The complete Craic Technologies microspot film thickness solution combines an advanced microspectrophotometer with the sophisticated Craic FilmPro software. This software is a plug-in module to Craic Technologies Lambdafire instrument control software. </p><p> It enables the user to measure film thickness by either transmission or reflectance of many types of materials and substrates.</p><p></p>
