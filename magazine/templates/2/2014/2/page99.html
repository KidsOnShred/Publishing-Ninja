<div class="img-default w-33"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/178937142714858.jpg"></div> <p>Ceramic materials are well-established in the global semiconductor manufacturing sector, where their unique physical and performance attributes deliver real commercial benefit for manufacturers and their sub-contractors.</p><p>Graphite has been used in processing for at least 35 years, while other materials such as pyrolitic boron nitride (PBN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) are also well established, having been employed in the sector for at least 25 years and 15 years respectively.</p><p>Their combination of purity, resistance to thermal shock and chemical resistance mean they are ideally suited to the unique requirements of this process.</p><p>Despite their effectiveness, further innovation in ceramic-based materials is being driven by the need to reduce cycle times and reject rates, extracting maximum value from capital equipment in a sector which is becoming more and more competitive.</p>Optimising the effect of end effectors<p>While ceramic materials are rarely used in the ’slicing’ process which creates individual ‘wafers’ from the monocrystal silicon ingots, they more than come into their own in the subsequent wafer processing steps including ion implantation, deposition and etch processes which introduce successive conducting and insulating layers into the wafer, before the wafers are broken down into individual chips.</p><p>The need for precision in the process has increased greatly as the size of connectors has dramatically reduced, from typically 30 nanometres to around 10 nanometres.</p><p>This issue is exacerbated by the desire to process larger individual wafers to increase overall productivity. While the largest wafers are currently 300mm in diameter, the move towards the processing of 450mm wafers places even great demands on the materials and components used at each stage of the process.</p><p>In most production facilities, the wafers are moved between individual processing stations by a robot. The wafers are necessarily very thin and fragile, meaning careful physical handling is essential , while the need for cleanliness is vital to prevent the introduction of contaminating particles into the wafer.</p><p>Key to the handling process is the ‘end effector’ on the robot arm which is responsible for picking up the wafer and transporting it between stations for processing. The end effector must have a good ratio of weight to stiffness and ideally be as pure as possible to minimise the risk of contamination to the wafers during processing.</p><p> There are two main choices for specifiers for the material for the end effector – aluminium and aluminium oxide (alumina) ceramic.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="img-default w-33"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/713171703740954.jpg"></div><p></p><p>Aluminium is a cost-effective option and over the years has been widely used, especially in applications where no aggressive chemicals are present.&nbsp; However, where these chemicals may be present, aluminium is not a good choice as it is difficult to keep clean due to its propensity to react chemically with cleaning media, deforming the end effector and potentially introducing further contaminants to the process. Using aluminium also presents physical issues for wafer handling operations. Its higher inertia can lead to less accurate movements at higher rates of motion, and it is relatively fragile and can be deformed quite easily, particularly if not correctly calibrated or if the operator positions the end effector against a hard surface. This deformation means that when the end effector picks up the wafer, it may not be correctly positioned, impacting on subsequent process stages. Furthermore, the deformation may not be noticeable to the naked eye, meaning multiple parts can be processed before the issue is spotted, all of which may end up being rejected, significantly increasing cost and waste and potentially impacting on order deadlines.</p><p>By contrast, high purity alumina can be ‘clean-fired’ to remove trace contaminants and offers reduced risk for specifiers and system designers. Boasting excellent strength and able to be cleaned with chemicals with no physical effects whatsoever, alumina end effectors are very stiff at lower masses, and so reduce the inertial problems associated with aluminium products.&nbsp; This allows faster robotic movements with a shorter settle time to an accurate position. Meanwhile, modern manufacturing processes allow the production of end effectors with enhanced tolerances and optimised surface finishes, minimising the risk of damage to the wafer. </p><p>The issue of deformation is negated too, as an alumina end effector will not deform at all until it reaches the point at which it physically fractures. </p><p> The choice between aluminium and alumina ceramic is a major consideration as&nbsp; the spaces between the individual racks in ‘cassettes’ in which wafers are stored at each station are reduced in a bid to save on space. This means that the end effector must itself be smaller and thinner but still able to cope with the weight of the larger 450mm wafers without deforming. Alumina has improved characteristics over aluminium in all these respects.</p><p></p><div class="img-default w-33 float-r"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/719103190116584.jpg"></div><p></p><p>Alumina offers benefits in other areas to, not least in the actual physical design of the end effector. In an attempt to reduced cycle times and make the process ‘intelligent’, there is a growing demand within the sector for end effectors to be fitted with optical detectors which can scan the entire cassette and move the robot arm automatically to the correct position to pick up or deposit a wafer. Meanwhile, manufacturers are also seeking smaller, thinner end effectors with the same vacuum capacity. The extra machining required to incorporate either, or even both of these features, would be very difficult with aluminium but achievable with alumina due to the latter’s greater strength at lower thicknesses. </p><div class="img-default float-r"> Optimising the deposition and etch processes <p>For the deposition process, the chamber wall must be chemically inert and also physically stable at high temperatures. Here, specifiers usually face a choice between a zirconia and alumina chamber liner. While zirconia is effective, it is significantly more expensive, and not so easy to adapt to individual requirements. Alumina, with a purity of 99.5 per cent or higher, has very strong dielectric qualities and is easily shaped to individual customer requirements, such as the inclusion of a slot in the wall or even the creation of a liner for an unusually shaped chamber.</p> <p>Another recently available capability is the application of a textured coating for reduced particle generation in CVD chambers with the aim of reducing mean time between maintenance (MTBM). As wafer throughput increases, film from the wafer is deposited on to the chamber walls and other internal alumina components. The texturing of these surfaces helps to prevent the film particles from flaking off and contaminating the wafer. This technology offer significant advantages over techniques such as bead-blasting whose roughening action can cause lasting physical damage to the surface, reducing service life. The textured coating has a rounded morphology, containing the particles better than the sharper morphologies created with bead blasting.</p> <p>The latest innovation is the creation of a metal matrix composite (MMC) material with applications such as a heat spreader. This material can be configured to match the expansion co-efficient of the alumina substrate, helping to avoid hot spots in applications such as electrostatic chucks. This potentially represents a major improvement over existing methods where to date only aluminium nitride has been used, with limited success. Diamond-like carbon coatings are also being used to increase the wear resistance of chuck surfaces to millions of wafer cycles before refurbishment is necessary.</p> <p>For etch reactors, the chamber walls are also frequently treated with coatings to enhance their resistance to fluorine etch gases. Traditional technologies in this area focus around the use of plasma coated yttria which creates only a mechanical bond with the substrate. However, recent innovations have created an yttria coating for the chamber dome and rings, which is covalently bonded to the alumina substrate.&nbsp; This means that unlike the plasma coated yttria, the coating cannot delaminate, nor can the bond fail.</p> Graphite and SiC – purity and performance <p>Graphite is used for a variety of applications in semi-conductor processing including components for ion implanters and as metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) susceptors.</p> <p>Key to the success of materials used in these applications is their purity (to avoid particle contamination and maximise wafer yield), and the extent to which this can be achieved without prohibitive cost.&nbsp; Graphite has dimensional integrity at very high temperatures, as well as, high chemical resistance, and desirable electrical and mechanical properties. Modern graphite purification processes are able to reduce impurities to 2-3 parts per million and are highly cost-effective when compared with those for the alternative materials for these applications such as molybdenum, tungsten and tantalum, all of which must be refined, at considerable cost, to achieve the same level of purity. They are also typically more difficult to machine and more expensive than graphite, whose enhanced absorption performance and other refractory properties make it more suitable in any case for interior components.</p> <p>CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) silicon carbide (SiC) is a very high purity (99.9995%+) material used in semiconductor process applications where long service life, high thermal conductivity, and plasma erosion resistance&nbsp; are required.&nbsp;&nbsp; CVD SiC is particularly well suited to applications such as wafer edge rings for rapid thermal processing (RTP), shower heads and focus rings for etch chambers, and as wafer carriers in MOCVD tools. CVD SiC wafer carriers for MOCVD applications offer unmatched erosion resistance in the high-temperature ammonia environment present in these tools.&nbsp; The material purity is also a significant advantage compared with conventional SiC-coated graphite wafer carriers which can contaminate the MOCVD chamber once the ammonia eats through the coating and exposes the underlying graphite.&nbsp; </p> <p>Modern manufacturing methods, using specially designed reactor chambers with silane gases, enable the production of a superior quality CVD SiC with monolithic substrates meaning there is no film interface where thermal mismatch and ultimately adhesion failure can occur. CVD SiC can now for the first time also be near net formed into ring shapes, with the initial production of the item very close to the final (net) shape, reducing the need for surface finishing. </p> <p>Similarly, Pyrolytic boron nitride (PBN) products are available with very high purity, offering premium electrical resistivity, dielectric strength, chemical resistance and the ability to operate at temperatures in excess of 1500ºC.&nbsp; Modern CVD PBN materials are particularly well suited to crystal growth and effusion cell environments for metal evaporation.&nbsp; Common applications for this material include vertical gradient freeze (VGF) crystal growth of gallium arsenide (GaAs) materials, and aluminium cathode evaporation in the production of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) large displays.</p> More than scratching the surface <p>Innovations in ceramics for semi-conductor applications focus around the optimisation of surfaces which can now be textured on components for ion implantation machines which are located at key points along the beam path to collect particulates and prevent them from contaminating the wafer downstream. Meanwhile, glassy carbon impregnation increases the density of the substrates, eliminating the presence of surface particulates, and so improving wear and erosion resistance.</p> <p>Graphite components can also be treated with a glassy carbon coating which again negates the production of surface particles, reducing sealed surface porosity and permeability while offering excellent release characteristics. These attributes are key as they help reduce cycle times, as the part does not ‘out-gas’ during the pump-down cycle.</p> <p>Other types of coating, particularly when optimally combined with state-of-the-art substrate materials, are making a measurable difference to product performance and life too. In the area of Chemical Mechanical Planarisation (CMP) products, for example, the typical choice of substrate for CMP conditioners has been stainless steel, but this is prone to corrosion during the CMP process, meaning that plastics and ceramics such as reaction bonded (RB) SiC have become an alternative option.&nbsp; The benefits of RBSiC are clear – the strength and purity achievable, as RBSiC does not introduce foreign elemental materials into the production process. The CMP conditioners’ abrading surfaces can now be executed with structural ‘edge’ features on the surface, instead of diamond abrasive, in a monolithically designed RBSiC part.&nbsp; The top surface then receives a pure CVD diamond coating for abrasion resistance.&nbsp; Therefore, unlike other diamond products, it does not contain a diamond grit which can become physically detached from the substrates and potentially increase defectivity on the wafer.&nbsp; The work of abrasion is now being performed solely e with the CVD diamond coated RBSiC surface.– something which has been achieved through new product designs in these highly pure materials, greatly minimising the content of trace metal contaminants such as nickel and cobalt. </p> <p>Another area where ceramic components manufacturers are increasingly able to add real value for their customers is through the use of co-ordinate measuring machine (CMM) vision systems that can create a CAD representation of a component from a solid model, with the scan of the model then used for co-ordinate generation for the manufactured part. This process enables the identification and correction of any errors in the drawings within a system which then directly instructs the manufacturing system that makes the part – guaranteeing the design will be directly translated into the final part.</p> <p>The materials themselves are developing too, with an increase in the number of graphite materials produced specifically for the semi-conductor manufacturing sector. The main attribute of these is increased hardness and erosion resistance, particularly for aperture components, lengthening life cycle thereby reducing PM cycles.</p><p>It is these innovations being driven by leading specialist ceramic product manufacturers committed to ongoing investment in research and development, which will continue to drive quality and productivity gains in throughout the semi-conductor manufacturing process.</p></div><p></p>
