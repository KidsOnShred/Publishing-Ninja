<p>Tessera Technologies is restructuring its DigitalOptics business (DOC) to cease its remaining manufacturing operations and refocus efforts on monetising DOC technologies, including solutions for imaging and MEMS technologies.</p> <p>The changes will enable the company to return its focus to its core IP business and substantially reduce Tessera's operating costs, and provide the organisation with a path to improved financial performance and profitability.</p> <p>These actions are the culmination of an in-depth review of strategic alternatives for DOC that was conducted in conjunction with the company’s financial advisors, the newly reconstituted board of directors and the new senior management team.</p> <p>Tessera expects to take restructuring, impairment and other exit charges of approximately $50 million to $55 million, with approximately 75 percent of that charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the remainder in the first half of 2014.</p> <p>As a result of the restructuring, the firm expects its quarterly DOC related operating expenses to be reduced by approximately $17 million, realised in full by the third quarter of 2014.</p> <p>Tom Lacey, Tessera’s chief executive officer, comments, “After an exhaustive process of exploring multiple options, we have decided to cease DOC manufacturing operations and focus our resources in DOC on continuing to operate our image enhancement business, while also exploring new ways to realize value from our extensive DOC intellectual property portfolio, including a sale, licensing or other means."</p> <p>He continues, "While the strategic process ultimately did not lead to a sale of the mems|cam business, we achieved solid proof of concept by demonstrating working mems|cam camera modules, including shipping pre-production units that generated substantial customer interest. We strongly believe that there is significant value in the related intellectual property that has been developed, including our camera module, MEMS, and image enhancement technologies. Additionally, we continue to believe our mems|cam technology is unique and novel and may be incorporated into mobile devices in the future. To that end, we intend to maintain a small team of MEMS engineers to further the mems|cam technology and pursue possible avenues to unlock the value of this powerful technology.”</p> <p>Continues Lacey, “I wish to sincerely thank the many talented and passionate employees who have contributed towards the development of the DOC’s mems|cam technology and products. I look forward to continuing to drive our world-class image enhancement business to further develop and commercialise our market-leading imaging technology, intellectual property and products, many of which have been employed by leading smartphone manufacturers around the world. I remain optimistic about our future and the many opportunities ahead.”</p>
