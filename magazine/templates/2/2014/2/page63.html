<p>InvenSense has introduced a number of products based on MEMS technology.</p> <p>The first is an ultra low-power motion and audio family of solutions enabling a complete ‘AlwaysOn’ wearable experience.</p> <p>The InvenSense ICM-20655 (world’s lowest power 6-axis motion SoC), the ICM-20955 (world’s lowest power 9-axis motion SoC) and the ICS-43430 (best in class I2S microphone) are sampling to select customers. InvenSense continues to ship in volume its current generation of 6- and 9-axis automatic activity recognition solutions.</p> <p>The ICM-20655 and ICM-20955 motion solutions are paired with the InvenSense Automatic Activity Recognition (AAR) software library, resulting in ‘AlwaysOn’ activity detection including: run, walk, bike, stationary, and sleep on a wrist-worn wearable device.</p> <p>InvenSense’s ultra low-power 2mW 6-axis motion is enabling a new generation of activity trackers. Beyond providing more accurate pedometer functionality, combining low-power gyroscopes and accelerometers with advanced AAR software, enables detection of a broader set of activities ideal for next generation smart watch, fitness band, and fitness watch applications.</p> <p>The firm is also introducing the ICS-40720 World’s First 70 dB MEMS microphone for consumer electronics. The device is a compact 4mm x 3mm x 1.2mm package and has a low current consumption of 160 μA.</p> <p>InvenSense is also sampling of the ICS-40720 analogue MEMS microphone for the CE market to select customers. The ICS‐40720 is an RF‐hardened, high performance, ultra low-noise, low-power, differential analogue output MEMS microphone.</p> <p>This product targets consumer electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, digital still/video cameras, teleconferencing systems, Bluetooth headsets, notebook PCs, and security/surveillance.</p> <p>The new InvenSense microphone solution includes an innovative new MEMS sensor and an advanced ultra low-noise signal conditioning amplifier. The ICS‐40720 has very high SNR and extended wideband frequency response for excellent sound quality and intelligibility. Low power consumption enables long battery life for portable consumer electronic applications.</p> <p>“Achieving 70dB SNR is a technological breakthrough for MEMS based microphones. The InvenSense ICS‐40720 is a disruptive product, meeting the market requirement for a human-like interface between people and consumer electronics,” says Ali Foughi, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at InvenSense. “With this introduction, InvenSense has established itself as the leader in audio performance.”</p> <p>The final product is the ICS-43430 is a high performance, low power, 65 dB SNR I2S digital output MEMS microphone addressing the growing market needs of ‘AlwaysOn’ voice user interfaces needed by today’s wearables. The I²S interface allows the ICS-43430 to connect directly to application processors or DSPs, without the need for an audio codec in the system.</p> <p>“InvenSense’s pioneering ‘AlwaysOn’ audio and motion solutions are synergistic with the Internet of Things (IoT) requisite to track behaviour, enhance contextual awareness, and help sensor-driven decision analytics,” comments Ali Foughi, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at InvenSense.</p> <p>“InvenSense created a paradigm shift by taking the industry from simple step counting to precise activity recognition with our initial introduction of low power gyroscope based wearable solutions. With the advent of a 2mW 6-axis motion, InvenSense is raising the bar yet again for ‘AlwaysOn’ power conscious wearable devices.</p>
