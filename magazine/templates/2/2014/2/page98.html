<p>RF Micro Devices, Inc, an innovator in the design and manufacture of high-performance radio frequency ("RF") solutions, and TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. , a premier RF solutions supplier and technology innovator, have announced a definitive merger agreement under which the companies will combine in an all-stock transaction. To reflect the nature of this transaction as a merger of equals, the new company ("NewCo") will have a new name and shared leadership team. The boards of directors of both RFMD and TriQuint have unanimously approved the transaction.</p> <p>The merger will create new growth opportunities in three large global markets - mobile devices, network infrastructure and aerospace/defence - with scale advantages, innovative new products and a greatly improved operating model. RFMD and TriQuint together will offer the industry's broadest portfolio of critical enabling technologies to develop and commercialize tightly integrated solutions at record speeds. The combination will foster a new wave of exciting mobile devices that are broadly accessible and offer dramatically higher data throughput, to the benefit of carriers and consumers alike. The combination also creates a leader in infrastructure and defense (with approximately $500 million in annual revenue), with a broad portfolio of products and foundry services supporting applications including radar, next generation base stations, optical communications, and the Internet of Things.</p> <p>With today's transaction, which is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, TriQuint shareholders will receive 1.675 shares of NewCo and RFMD shareholders will receive 1 share of NewCo for each TriQuint or RFMD share held. At the closing of the transaction, the companies will execute a one-for-four reverse stock split resulting in approximately 145 million shares outstanding.</p> <p>Former shareholders of RFMD and TriQuint will each own approximately 50 percent of the new company post-merger. The transaction represents an implied price of $9.73 for each TriQuint share, representing a 5.4% premium based on the closing price of $9.23 for TriQuint on February 21, 2014. The combination is expected to achieve at least $150 million in cost synergies; $75 million in annualized synergies exiting the first year after closing and an additional $75 million exiting the second year. The transaction is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in the first full fiscal year following the closing of the transaction.</p> <p>"The world's demand for mobile data is growing exponentially," said RFMD CEO and President Bob Bruggeworth. "The combination of TriQuint and RFMD creates a new leader in RF solutions with expertise in mobile devices and complex infrastructure and global defense applications. With this merger of equals, we will bring under one roof all of the critical RF building blocks necessary to innovate at the heart of what makes mobile mobile - the crucial back-and-forth data flow between the mobile device and the network. We will harness this innovation for the benefit of all our customers - from mobile to infrastructure to defence."</p> <p>"I believe this is an industry shaping event," said TriQuint CEO Ralph Quinsey. "Through this combination of RFMD and TriQuint we form a diversified market leader with a highly compatible combination of products and technologies and a world class team focused on innovation and superior financial results. The alignment of culture between the two companies and the well matched products, capabilities and technologies will create compelling new opportunities."</p> <p>This transaction combines complementary product portfolios, featuring power amplifiers (PAs), power management integrated circuits (PMICs), antenna control solutions, switch-based products and premium filters - and leverages these to deliver the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of high-performance mobile solutions. It will also strengthen the combined company's service to the infrastructure and defence/aerospace industries and enable advanced gallium nitride (GaN) solutions for additional markets and applications.</p> <p>The new company will have a shared leadership team. TriQuint CEO Ralph Quinsey will serve as non-executive Chairman, and RFMD CEO Bob Bruggeworth will serve as Chief Executive Officer. The board of directors will be made up of ten directors, with five directors from the existing board of each company.&nbsp; Eight of the ten directors will be independent.
