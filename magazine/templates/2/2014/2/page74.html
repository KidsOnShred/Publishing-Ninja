<p>IHS Technology says the global market for digital power is undergoing explosive growth, with global revenue for digital power supplies is forecast to approach $3.3 billion in 2014 and then climb to $11.8 billion in 2018, according to “The World Market for Digital Power - 2014” IHS report.</p><p>[Image Needed]</p><p>Meanwhile, global revenue for digital power ICs will top $605 million in 2014, and then reach $3.1 billion by 2018. “The market for digital power solutions is already well-established in the server and telecommunication markets,” says Jonathon Eykyn, power supply and storage component analyst for IHS.</p><p>“However, IHS is now starting to see growing adoption across a much broader range of products and applications, which is driving rapid growth.” Digital power offers customers many advantages over traditional analogue power, Eykyn notes, including the reduction of the overall bill-of-materials cost.</p><p>This is done by consolidating the number of discrete components, reducing the carbon footprint, increasing power density, providing the ability to monitor and optimise power levels and system requirements while in operation, and speeding time to market for products.</p><p>IHS believes Delta Electronics held the largest share of the 2013 digital power supply market, with an estimated 10.3 percent of total industry revenue. It was followed by Eltek and Emerson with 9.1 percent and 8.8 percent market share, respectively.</p><p>In the digital power IC market, Texas Instruments led with an estimated 9.8 percent. Infineon and Powervation came next, garnering 9.6 percent and 8.9 percent market share, respectively.</p><p>“Both the digital power supply and digital power IC markets remain fairly fragmented, with no suppliers having a dominant position,” points out Eykyn. “This means that competition and innovation remain high as companies seek to win major customers.”</p><p> The report includes analysis of the opportunities for AC-DC, DC-DC and DC-AC power supplies, as well as AC-DC, isolated DC-DC and non-isolated DC-DC switching regulators and converters across 16 applications - with forecasts through 2018.</p>
