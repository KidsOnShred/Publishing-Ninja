<p>With more than 150 million TPMS sensors sold worldwide, Infineon Technologies is one of the leaders on the TPMS market.</p> <p>The latest generation of Infineon's TPMS, the SP37, is a highly integrated TPMS sensor which embeds measurement of pressure and radial acceleration (2 DoF) with a low-power microcontroller, a LF receiver and an RF transmitter in a system in package integrating only two dies.</p> <p>This high integration of functions allows customers to build a complete system with few external components and thus enable system cost savings.</p> <p>The SP37 sensors inherits its MEMS technology from the acquisition of the Norwegian Sensonor in 2003. Therefore, highly reliable measurements in harsh environments are possible by the use of the mature and low-cost triple stack hermetic wafer bonding technology in combination with buried piezoresistors and conductors.</p> <p>The SP37 sensor is assembled in a small outline 14-pin package and operates under a temperature range of -40 to +125Â°C.</p> <p>Due to the flexibility of the Craic Technologies design, sampling areas can range from over 100 microns across to less than a micron. Designed for both research and the production environment, it incorporates a number of easily modified processing recipes, the ability to create new film recipes and sophisticated tools for analysing data.</p> <p>With the addition of spectral mapping from Craic Technologies, the firm says film thickness maps of entire devices can be created.</p>
