<p>STMicroelectronics has introduced a new MEMS based 2-axis gyroscope specifically optimised for optical image stabilisation in smartphones and digital still cameras.</p> <p>Benefiting from compact dimensions of just 2.3 x 2.3 x 0.7mm, the L2G2IS can be easily integrated into the next generation of stabilised camera modules, where the dimensions of the components are critical.</p> <p>At a size 50 percent smaller than the previous generation by area and 60 percent smaller in volume, the L2G2IS still provides the high performance demanded by the applications and consumers.</p> <p>"Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) has become an essential feature in today's smartphones and digital still cameras, thanks to the availability of dedicated MEMS gyroscopes," says Fabio Pasolini, General Manager, Motion MEMS Division, STMicroelectronics. "With the L2G2IS, ST has once again raised the bar and set a new standard, dramatically reducing the volume and area required by this key function."</p> <p>Key technical features of the new device include ± 100dps / ± 200dps full-scale range, 3- and 4-wire SPI interface, and integrated low- and high-pass filters with selectable bandwidth. The L2G2IS operates with a supply voltage range of 1.7V to 3.6V.</p> <p>ST has more than 900 MEMS-related patents granted or pending worldwide.</p> <p>Samples of ST's new 2-axis L2G2IS gyroscope are available now and budgetary unit pricing is $1.70 for orders over 1,000 pieces.</p>
