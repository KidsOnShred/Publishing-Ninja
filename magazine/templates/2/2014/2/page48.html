<p>Teledyne DALSA has received a financial commitment totalling $13 million from Investissement Québec to expand the company’s MEMS and Infrared Imaging capabilities in the Province of Québec.</p> <p>The funding consists of a $3 million grant to Teledyne DALSA Semiconductor aimed at increasing production capacity for MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) at the company’s Bromont, Québec facility. </p> <p>MEMS are tiny electro-mechanical devices found in a wide variety of consumer, automotive, and telecommunications devices. Teledyne DALSA’s Semiconductor division in Bromont is one of the world’s “pure-play” specialty MEMS manufacturers.</p> <p>In addition, Investissement Québec is providing Teledyne DALSA a $10 million contribution to develop advanced infrared imaging products at its Bromont and Montreal facilities.</p> <p>An innovator in visible and x-ray digital imaging technology, Teledyne DALSA is extending its reach into infrared imaging. Unlike visible imaging cameras and sensors, infrared devices are able to see objects not visible to the human eye by detecting the heat the objects emit.</p> <p>"MEMS and Infrared Imaging are two strategic areas of focus for Teledyne DALSA with good growth potential,” comments Brian Doody, CEO of Teledyne DALSA, Inc.</p> “The development and full production of infrared devices in Québec will further strengthen our position as a leader in digital imaging and semiconductors, at a time when the infrared imaging market is experiencing strong growth. In addition, by increasing our production capacity of MEMS chips, we will be able to meet the growing demand for microsystems as they become indispensable in many areas.”
