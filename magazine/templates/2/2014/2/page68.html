<p>The global IGBT market by application is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 13.92 percent from 2013 to 2018. </p> <p>This is according to the&nbsp; report “IGBT and Thyristor Market by Application (Power, Renewable Energy, Motor Drives and Others) and by Geography (North America, Europe, APAC and ROW) - Analysis and Forecast 2013 - 2018” available from marketsandmarkets.</p> <p>The global thyristor market by application is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 9.52 percent from 2013 to 2018.</p> <p>The insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a three-terminal power semiconductor device primarily used as an electronic switch and in newer devices is noted for combining high efficiency and fast switching. It switches electric power in many modern appliances: variable-frequency drives (VFDs), electric cars, trains, variable speed refrigerators, air-conditioners and even stereo systems with switching amplifiers.</p> <p>The Global IGBT and Thyristor Market by application is in its growth stage, however, it contains a great potential across many industry verticals. The IGBT is gaining attention due to lower switching losses that reduces thermal stress on the electric devices and leads to longer life cycle and greater reliability.</p> <p>The highlighting features like high efficiency, external thermal performance and soft switching operations have made IGBT the best suited device in electronic market. The aging power infrastructure in developed geographical regions demands replacement, increasing number of offshore wind farm, increase in the government incentivisation to establish HVDC grid.</p> <p>De-carbonisation of power system and deployment of smart grid will boost IGBT and Thyristor market which would be the captivating essentials for new entrants as well as winning opportunities for the established players.</p> <p>APAC has been identified as the fastest growing region, with China and Japan leading the way. North America and ROW are also very promising markets, with Germany and the U.K. in Europe, and the Middle-East and Latin America in ROW providing impetus to the growth. The report profiles more than 10 promising players in the IGBT and Thyristor market ecosystem.</p> <p>The competitive landscape of the market presents a very interesting picture, where large number of small players has become a force to reckon with. The market is witnessing large scale collaboration and partnership across the value chain with number of tier-one players around the globe.</p>
