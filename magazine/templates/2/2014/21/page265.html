<p class="ui-droppable">Rudolph Technologies, Inc has announced that it has received a large order from one of Taiwan’s providers of independent semiconductor manufacturing services in assembly and test (OSAT). The order includes: multiple NSX systems for two-dimensional (2D) macro defect inspection, the Wafer Scanner Inspection Series for three-dimensional (3D) inspection and bump height metrology, and Discover software for yield optimization. The sale demonstrates Rudolph’s continuing leadership in providing comprehensive inspection and metrology solutions for today’s most advanced wafer-level chip-scale packaging (WLCSP) and bumping processes.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">“The importance of advanced packaging processes continues to grow as semiconductor manufacturers seek to pack more power and capability into smaller and smaller packages,” said Mike Goodrich, vice president and general manager of Rudolph’s Inspection Business Unit. “We provide a comprehensive solution to help our customers ensure the performance of these challenging new processes. The Wafer Scanner system provides fast 3D inspection and measurement of bumping processes and the NSX system delivers high-throughput 2D inspection of complex patterns and components such as redistribution layers (RDL) and under bump metal. The Discover software ties it all together with sophisticated yield enhancement capabilities.”</p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-381" style="opacity: 1; width: 579.310344827586px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative; float: none;"><img src="http://www.publishing.ninja/publisher/content/img/image-21-381-2014-09-08.jpg"></div><p class="ui-droppable" style="">“By providing an intelligent, comprehensive solution we were able to reduce the amount of review and improve the net throughput and net utilization in the factory. Our Fleet Management capabilities include recipe management and ensure consistent performance across multiple systems,” Goodrich adds.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The NSX family is the market leader for automated macro defect inspection for advanced packaging processes. NSX systems include specific solutions for processes using through silicon vias (TSVs) to connect multiple die in a single package, as well as edge trimming, wafer alignment during bonding processes and sawn wafers on film frames. Rudolph’s Wafer Scanner System provides the inspection and metrology for 3D/2D bumps and RDL required throughout post-fab processes for both standard and flip chip wafers.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Discover Software is Rudolph’s inline defect and metrology analysis and data management system. When bundled with Fleet Management, engineers in a high volume environment are able to assess the performance of recipes across multiple tools and multiple products, typical of a high volume OSAT. In addition, expert knowledge can be programmed into the system and applied to data monitoring 24x7. This software sale builds upon the customer’s previous installation of fault detection and classification (FDC) software, implemented across the entire factory for process control and yield improvement.</p>
