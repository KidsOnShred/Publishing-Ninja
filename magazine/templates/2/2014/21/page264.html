<p class="ui-droppable">memsstar Limited has launched its ORBIS platform of etch and deposition process tools for MEMS manufacturing. ORBIS systems deliver the industry’s most advanced single-wafer process capability, required to meet the uniformity and repeatability requirements for advanced MEMS manufacturing.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">“Adoption of MEMS technology is increasing rapidly, with the explosion of mobile devices, the ‘Internet of Things’ and the trillion sensors roadmap,” said Tony McKie, CEO of memsstar. “With such diversity in applications and increasing performance and capability, manufacturers are clearly demanding process advances, as smaller, high-functionality MEMS devices can no longer tolerate process variations that impact performance. Our new ORBIS platforms build on our first-generation systems to deliver significant process and hardware enhancements that advance manufacturing capability and performance in the MEMS industry.”</p> The ORBIS platform enhances memsstar’s production-proven and unique processing technology, which has seen strong market acceptance and has become an enabling technology for next-generation MEMS manufacturing. On the process side, enhancements built into the ORBIS platform include fully integrated process monitoring and endpoint control, as well as a new high-selectivity package. At the same time, the platform’s hardware has been upgraded, which results in even better uniformity and repeatability, critical to improving yield.
