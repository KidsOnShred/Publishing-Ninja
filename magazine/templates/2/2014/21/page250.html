The introduction of stacked die technology has made it possible to put much more computing power in a small space, a benefit for hand-held appliances as well as many larger designs. But with the benefit came a challenge for the makers of stacked die: how to find the gap-type defects that may exist in a stack of 4, 8, 16 or more die?<p></p><p></p><p>What the stacked die manufacturers want to know is not only whether a delamination or other gap-type defect is present, but its exact location, and especially just where, vertically, it lies in the stack. Which die is the defect associated with? X-ray won’t find these defects. Finding them by destructive physical analysis would be very time-consuming and difficult.</p><p></p><p>An acoustic microscope might be able to pulse ultrasound into one surface of the stack and on the opposite surface collect acoustic shadows caused by sound-blocking gaps, but this would only tell manufacturers that a defect was present, not which die it is next to. What stacked die manufacturers really have wanted was a means to use echoes to generate depth-selective data.</p><p></p><p>The problem exists in development work, when engineers are trying to work out the exact processes that will let them turn out die stacks without critical defects. At this stage the die stacks have not been encapsulated, so they should - in theory - transmit ultrasound very readily. </p><p></p><p>The challenge of multiple echoes</p><p>The die stacks do transmit ultrasound pulsed into them by the scanning transducer nicely. The problem is that the number of material interfaces sets up a much larger number of echoes arriving at the transducer, and some of the echoes overlap. What the operator of an acoustic microscope wants to know is which of the horde of echoes actually shows him the interface between, say, the bottom of die #5 and the adhesive below it This is the problem that, for quite a long time, could not be solved, and it is the imaging behavior that most sharply differentiates unencapsulated die stacks from single-die configurations.</p><p></p><p>In plastic-encapsulated single die packages, the common gap-type defects are delaminations, non-bonds, voids, cracks, and the like. In die stacks, the defects are typically non-bonds and delaminations. In a die stack, these defects degrade the long-term reliability of the stack. For one thing, normal thermal cycling in service may cause the gaps to expand and break connections. Alternately they are natural collection points for humidity and contaminants that percolate into component packages, which create miniature electrolytic cells that can cause breaks in connections.</p><p></p><p>But single-die packages typically have fewer interfaces to reflect ultrasound. The first interface is generally the top surface of the encapsulant. The next interface may be the encapsulant-to-die interface, but only over a limited region of the package. In other regions the next interface may involve the die paddle, lead fingers, or other features.</p><p></p><p>Die stacks generally have many more internal material interfaces than will be found in single-die packages. The area of interest at each interface encompasses the whole x-y area of each die. An engineer whose goal is to examine a die stack under development to learn whether internal defects are present will run straight into the problem of multiple echoes. The ultrasonic transducer of an acoustic microscope raster-scans the surface of the part. As it scans at speeds exceeding 1 m/s (Sonoscan’s C-SAM systems), it pulses ultrasound into the part and receives the return echoes from material interfaces thousands of times per second. The echo from each pulse is a potential pixel in the acoustic image, although it may also be treated simply as data in automated image analysis.</p><p></p><div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-343" style="float: left; opacity: 1; width: 566.101694915254px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-21-343-2014-09-01.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 1: Diagrammatic side view of the virtual die stack produced by software tool. The virtual defects can be placed by the software tool.</div></div><p>If the pulse encounters no material interfaces in the part, there will be no return echo and the pixel will be black. If there is an echo of moderate amplitude (i.e., more than zero but considerably less than 100% of the pulsed amplitude), the pixel will be some shade of gray. If the pulse encounters a gap where the difference in acoustic properties between a solid material (silicon, encapsulant, copper) and air is extreme, more than 99.99% of the pulse will be reflected and the resulting pixel will be bright white. The engineer hoping that he is imaging a defect-free component does not want to see white features in the acoustic image. A die stack is more complicated because it has many more interfaces - two per die, so that a four-die stack has at least eight interfaces, and an eight-die stack has at least 16 interfaces. Before encapsulation, it is possible to image these stacks acoustically. The problem is simply the number of interfaces, and the huge number of echoes that is produced. Consider: ultrasound pulsed into an unencapsulated die stack for the purpose of imaging the top surface of die #6 will first encounter the top of die #1. Part of the ultrasound is reflected to the transducer, while the remainder travels deeper. </p><p></p><p>This remainder is partly reflected from the bottom of die #1, and the remainder once again travels deeper. But the reflected portion of the signal has to pass through the material interface at the top of die #1, and here part of it is reflected downward. Of the portion transmitted downward, a portion will be reflected upward by the material interface at the bottom of die #1, and so on. By the time a small portion of the original pulse reaches the top surface of die #6, it has left behind it a large number of secondary echoes traveling both upward and downward. So how does one image the top surface of die #6? The problem is to isolate and capture that one set of echoes that shows this material interface clearly. It is possible, but only just, that an experienced acoustic microscope operator can isolate and capture this image, but the work could be long and tedious in the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Sorting out the echoes</p><p>In conjunction with the Technical University of Dresden, Sonoscan succeeded in developing a software tool that sorts out the echoes and finds the echo of interest far more rapidly than can be done by trial and error. The software asks the user to input information about the physical characteristics (density, acoustic velocity) of the materials in the stack. It also asks for the precise dimensions of the individual die, of the stack, and of the substrate. </p><p></p><p>From this data the software tool creates a virtual die stack that is, as far as possible, identical in its dimensions and acoustic properties to the physical die stack. Figure 1 shows the theoretical side view of one such virtual stack. In development work, the software tool permits the user to create a virtual delamination (i.e., an area that will reflect nearly 100% of the pulse) on each die. If there are 8 die, the virtual delaminations will be staggered left to right so that none of them overlap. The software tool next predicts the echo patterns that will be produced when a virtual ultrasonic transducer of a specified design images the virtual die stack.</p><p></p><p>To this point the work, and results, have been entirely virtual, but now the connection to the physical die stack is initiated. Working with the virtual die stack, the engineer looks for the echo from, say, the top surface of die #6. He can identify it by the arrival time of the echo, which the software has calculated. On the control screen, he looks at a waveform made from an A-scan pulse - that is, all of the echoes received from a single pulse in to a single x-y coordinate. At the point on the waveform corresponding to the top of die #6, he carefully moves more closely together the two vertical bars that define the gate for the interface at the top of die #6.</p><p></p><div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-344" style="float: right; opacity: 1; width: 554.761904761905px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-21-344-2014-09-01.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 2: Physical die stack imaged acoustically at die #8 using the imaging parameters established by the software tool. The numeral 8 and the adjacent trenches are gaps that were etched into the die before stacking.</div></div><p>Once he has used A-scan echoes to define the gate, the engineer switches to the C-SAM system’s C-mode echoes. Using these, he makes the acoustic image of the virtual delamination at the top of die #6. He will move the gate slightly upward and downward several times in order to maximize the quality of the acoustic image. </p><p></p><p>Having gained reasonably good control over the identification of the depths (measured in nanoseconds) where the gate for the top of die #6 lies, the engineer can move the imaging parameters that he has derived to the physical die stack. Here the initial results will be better than could have been achieved by lengthy trial and error. As he did with the virtual die, the engineer will carefully tweak the imaging parameters for the top of die #6 and the other depths of interest. When he is satisfied with the results, he will move the imaging parameters back to the virtual die stack and do a bit more tweaking. Soon he will have defined exactly the imaging parameters that he needs to image this die stack and others of the same design. </p><p></p><p>Figure 2 is is the acoustic image, made with the virtual die stack software tool, of one gate in a physical die stack. This physical die stack, made for testing purposes, has physical “defects” etched into the top of each die. The etching on each die includes the die number (there are 8 die in the stack) and four rectangular trenches. Figure 2 was made by first imaging the virtual die stack created by the software tool, and then applying the imaging parameters to the physical die.</p><p></p><p>The goal was to find the echoes that would image the surface of the deepest die. In Figure 2, the numeral 8 has the bright white appearance that corresponds to successful imaging of an air gap. The three trenches alongside the numeral are also bright white. The numerals 5, 6, and 7 (barely) are also visible, but they are darker than the background because they lie above the gate for the surface of die #8. These numerals block the ultrasound coming from the depth of interest and therefore appear in the image as dark acoustic shadows, regions where no echo was received.</p><p></p><p>Summary</p><p>The software tool from Sonoscan greatly simplifies the identification of the return echoes that correctly image each depth of interest, which has long been an obstacle in imaging die stacks. The tool makes it possible for developers of stacked die to image the die stacks acoustically for gap-type defects and have confidence in the results.</p>
