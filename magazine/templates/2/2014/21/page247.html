Many of the tools used in advanced packaging regularly generate notifications and alerts regarding their current operating status and condition. Seldom is the value of this data fully exploited. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Often it is collected and analyzed only retrospectively to determine the cause of an equipment malfunction. In the worst case, this valuable data is simply ignored. Automatic fault detection and classification (FDC) monitors this critical data to provide a real time assessment of equipment operating conditions, including tool to tool comparisons, trend analysis, predictive warnings of impending failure, immediate notification of fault conditions and predefined responses to pause or halt the process. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">FDC can dramatically reduce damage to work in progress, reduce repair and maintenance cycle times, improve throughput, increase tool uptime, and reduce labor costs for operators and engineers. This article examines the application of automated FDC to a wafer sawing process. It describes the FDC system architecture, the various signals available for monitoring and the relationships between the signals and process performance. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Sawing process/challenges</p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-338" style="opacity: 1; width: 541.592920353982px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative; float: none;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-21-338-2014-09-01.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 2: FDC Architecture</div></div><p class="ui-droppable">In wafer level packaging processes, wafers (or wafer-like substrates) must eventually be cut into individual die. The cutting process has two steps (figure 1). First, a laser cuts a groove through the device layers on the wafer surface. Then a diamond-coated saw blade, following the laser groove, cuts through the substrate material. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The saw cut is usually performed in two steps, with a shallow initial cut followed by a final through cut. Problems can arise at any stage in the dicing process. The laser groove may be misaligned, too shallow or contain debris. The saw cut may not follow the groove or may cause excessive chipping. In any case, problems in the dicing process that result in defective devices are especially costly because they result in the loss of fully processed and known-good die. The tools used in the dicing process typically generate a number of signals that, if properly monitored, can offer significant improvements in process performance, including: reducing preventable product loss by immediately halting the process when an error condition is detected, reducing engineering costs by eliminating manual tracking and directing resources to problem tools and subsystems, reducing total cost of ownership by increasing tool uptime and throughput. Tables 1 and 2 list some of the more significant signals available from laser grooving and wafer sawing tools and describe the likely impact of signal variations on process performance. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Automated FDC Architecture</p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-339" style="opacity: 1; width: 521.56862745098px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative; float: none;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-21-339-2014-09-01.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 3: Wafer saw spindle speed</div></div><p class="ui-droppable">The value of the information contained in the signals generated by laser and saw tools is often not fully realized for at least two reasons: 1) Manual monitoring of the signals is tedious and time consuming. 2) Variations in many of the signals have little or no impact on process performance so that responding to every excursion is not efficient or productive. Automated FDC addresses both of these. Once setup, the system provides constant monitoring with immediate alerts to out of spec conditions and no time-based labor costs for valuable engineering resources. In addition, intelligent monitoring and advanced process modelling techniques allow the system to distinguish critical conditions that affect process outcomes from those that have no impact. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-340" style="opacity: 1; width: 443.404255319149px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative; float: none;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-21-340-2014-09-01.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 4: Kerf alarms over 5 minutes in duration</div></div><p class="ui-droppable">The system gateway interfaces directly to the tool providing connection to the FDC host as well as factory automation and control systems (figure 2). Programmable response protocols allow the factory EAP server to halt, pause or abort the process immediately upon receipt of appropriate direction from the FDC system. At the same time, the wafer currently in the tool and any upstream work in process can be flagged by the MES for inspection or other appropriate action. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Reduce scrap</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Some signals offer a real-time indication of the quality of the cut. Immediate response to excursions of these signals outside acceptable limits can halt the process before damage occurs, preventing the loss of valuable die. For example, variations in the spindle speed and current can indicate excessive chipping, misalignment, blade breakage, or several other conditions that can cause immediate damage to the wafer and devices. At the same time the speed and current also vary when the saw is cutting or not cutting (as it moves between lines) (figure 3). </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-341" style="opacity: 1; width: 486.440677966102px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative; float: none;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-21-341-2014-09-01.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 5 - Comparing tool performance</div></div><p class="ui-droppable">The FDC system has the ability to correlate speed and current with cutting/not cutting conditions and report only anomalies that may cause damage. For example, if the root cause of the problem is poor laser groove quality, which can be reworked, immediate interdiction at the saw saves not only the wafer in the saw but also all work in the queue back to the laser tool. Given the value of wafers at this point in the manufacturing process, a single interdiction may well pay for the entire cost of the automated FDC system.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Reduce engineering costs</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Engineering time is a significant cost in many wafer sawing processes. Automated monitoring eliminates much of the time spent manually monitoring or reviewing equipment logs. Equally important, intelligent alarms direct engineering resources to critical events and provide the information needed to correct the fault condition without undue delay. The FDC system√ïs ability to accumulate and report performance statistics over time is a valuable tool for identifying existing or potential problems that may then be addressed proactively, before they result in tool downtime or product losses. Figure 4 shows cumulative data for kerf alarms over 5 minutes in duration on a number of saw tools. The same data is plotted graphically at the top and in tabular format below. The largest contribution is for kerf check: off center (K0039). Saw 24 has the highest cumulative total with saws 20 and 02 also making large contributions. The second highest total is for kerf check: target not found (K0044) with saw 20 making the largest contribution. Given this information engineers may want to take a closer look at saw 20 to determine why alarms are more frequent for that tool.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-342" style="opacity: 1; width: 481.751824817518px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative; float: none;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-21-342-2014-09-01.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 6: Wafer saw frequency distribution</div></div><p class="ui-droppable">Similar data comparing tool performance may be presented graphically as in figure 5 which plots average spindle current over time for several tools. Here it is apparent that the tool represented in yellow is 1) initially running at a slightly higher average spindle current than the other tools and 2) the average shifts stepwise to an even higher value during the plotted time interval. As in the previous example, such information can be used to direct attention to the anomalous performance to determine the cause and take corrective action.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Reduce cost of ownership</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Cost of ownership is almost always a function of tool throughput and uptime. Increasing either reduces the capital cost contribution for every device manufactured. Automated FDC eliminates unnecessary downtime for alarms that do not impact process performance. At the same time, by providing engineers with detailed information about the nature of critical alarms, it shortens the time required to recover and restart the process. F</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Figure 6 shows the frequency distribution for a wafer sawing process. The central peak represents normal operations. The tail to the right represents longer times, mostly resulting from kerf alarms that required manual interdiction. A smaller peak to the left contains aborted runs, mostly the result of alignment or setup/recipe issues. Given this information engineers can focus their efforts on problem areas to try to reduce the number of manual interdictions and aborted runs, and perhaps also to try to reduce the cycle time for routine operations. Plots such as this one provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the effect of changes in the process.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Conclusion</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Automated FDC provides an efficient and cost effective means to realize the full value of information contained in condition signals and alarms generated by many process tools. It allows manufacturers to reduce losses of valuable finished die, reduce engineering costs for manual monitoring and reduce cost of ownership by increasing throughput and uptime. Intelligent alarms and sophisticated process modeling provide timely response and direct valuable engineering resources where they can have the greatest impact on process performance and yield enhancement.</p>
