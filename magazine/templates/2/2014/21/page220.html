<h2><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.1;">A New Era Of Accuracy In Die- And Flip-Chip Bonding Is Upon Us, Taking Us To Mass-Market Silicon Photonics</span><br></h2><p>As the development of ever smaller consumer devices loaded with exciting new communication functions marches on without loosing a beat, the providers of manufacturing equipment such as flip-chip and die bonders are striving to keep up with demand.</p> <p></p> <p>The progress in computer technology is becoming increasingly dependent on faster data transfer between and within microchips. Optical interconnect may provide a way forward, and silicon photonics may prove particularly useful, once it is integrated on standard silicon chips.</p> <p>Thus, silicon photonics will open up a new area were devices can be made using existing semiconductor fabrication techniques. And since silicon is used as the substrate of choice for most integrated circuits, it is possible to create hybrid devices, which integrate optical and electronic components together on a single microchip. Consequently, silicon photonics applications are actively researched by many major electronics manufacturers and major IDMs have already started volume production.</p> <p>Foremost on the agenda of equipment vendors are placement accuracy, throughput and auto load capabilities, efficiency and low cost of ownership. The selected few pioneers in this very demanding field are continuously improving their machines for the coming mass-market micro-assembly tasks.</p> <p>One trend is clear in this context: the front-end and back-end segments are moving closer together, forming a new mid-end segment. This specifically pertains to the coming silicon photonics era and accommodating various 3-D packaging technologies. </p> <p>The classic back-end assembly machine today is being pushed into a demanding cleanroom environment, standing foot to foot with front-end processing equipment. Cleanrooms are highly controlled environments which hinder potential problems created from impurities caused by particles, which can be toxic for any embedded silicon process.</p> <p>It takes a good deal of R&amp;D and financial stamina to get ahead in this challenging environment â€“ something that Amicra has had on its agenda for several years now to provide leading solutions. Several of our newest machines are in qualification runs at large chip houses worldwide, placing embedded silicon photonics dies on 12-inch wafers with fully automated high-end FOUP loading systems. It seems like everybody is working hard on this issue. The bounty for equipment makers being&nbsp;at the forefront of silicon photonics looks like the proverbial&nbsp;pot of gold.</p>
