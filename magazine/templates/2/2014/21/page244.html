<p class="ui-droppable">The CoventorWare suite is a design and simulation platform that has been used in hundreds of MEMS designs over the past thirteen years. It includes 2D-to-3D design entry, automatic meshing capabilities and a suite of field solvers that address specialised MEMS physics. The latest release addresses the increasing sophistication and complexity of MEMS devices that are enabling a vast new array of applications, products and devices that enable interaction between the virtual and physical worlds - a trend often referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">“MEMS devices are finding their way into new consumer and industrial application areas and products every day, many of which are putting unprecedented requirements for functionality and performance on MEMS developers. Our CoventorWare platform has been the foundation of hundreds of successful MEMS design projects, and with the newest release we are offering even more powerful and efficient ways to design these extremely complex devices. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Now designers can more accurately model more aspects of the design with fewer assumptions,” says Steve Breit, Vice President of Engineering at Coventor. “Engineers have an insatiable appetite for more speed, accuracy and automation in the design process, and those are the three key areas we have significantly improved with this latest release.”</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The CoventorWare 2014 suite features improvements in the tool’s electrostatics and coupled electromechanics solvers that provide speed-ups of up to ten times over previous versions of the software. A new accelerated coupling algorithm in the coupled electro-mechanics solver improves performance without compromising accuracy. The new release also includes improvements to the unique modal harmonic analysis capability specifically for piezo-mechanical resonators.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">To improve user efficiency, Coventor has added a range of productivity-oriented features that simplify and automate more user interactions and make scripting more complete and powerful. A new user interface design unifies the setup of all types of coupled electromechanical analyses and reduces opportunities for pilot error. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">In addition, users can more easily track the progress of simulations with real-time updates of additional information in the Job Queue. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Finally, a new scripting interface for transforming the input mesh and scaling material properties can eliminate time-consuming repetitive tasks by enabling users to automate parametric studies of design dimensions and sensitivity to manufacturing variations.</p>
