<p class="ui-droppable">The new SPH0641LM4H-1 microphone utilises Knowles’ low power, “Always On, Always Listening” technology to provide a high SNR component claimed to exhibit the lowest power draw in the world. Knowles says it is lower than the conventional analogue microphone and analogue-to-digital converter combination.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Compared to other solutions, this digital multi-mode microphone delivers up to three times less power consumption than other digital microphones. Also, at 3.50 x 2.65 x 0.98mm, the MEMS device is up to twenty percent smaller in size than other competing products. The product features sleep, low-power and standard mode and has a good acoustic performance per square millimetre. It is capable of superwide-band and enables sensitivity matching for better algorithm and RF immunity performance. For consumers, this new product supports a longer battery life and enables accurate voice recognition in various settings, such as social gatherings and sporting events.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">“As device functionality increases, preserving battery life is an important trend in the consumer electronics industry. To enhance the user experience, suppliers need to work with manufacturers to decrease the power required to operate a device,” says Mike Adell, Knowles’ Co-President of Mobile Consumer Electronics. “By applying our MEMS expertise and audio knowledge, our engineers enrich the user experience with a more accurate microphone that requires less power.”</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">“Before this product, design engineers were forced to choose between microphones with a high SNR and microphones with a low current draw. Our “Always On, Always Listening” technology allows engineers to have both capabilities in one product,” Thibault Kassir, Senior Director, Product Management, Mobile Consumer Electronics, continues. “This multi-mode microphone exceeds other digital solutions by offering the lowest power consumption in the smallest form factor.”</p>
