With a field wireless system, the field devices at a plant are able to communicate wirelessly with host systems that perform functions such as monitoring and control. Wireless communications offer many advantages, including the ability to install field devices in difficult-to-wire locations and reduced cabling costs.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Yokogawa has been developing a wide variety of ISA100 Wireless compliant technologies and devices such as wireless adapters that allow conventional wired devices to access wireless networks. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">GasSecure specialises in the development, manufacture, and sale of low power, high reliability wireless gas detectors that are used to monitor for hydrocarbon leaks at offshore platforms, tank farms, industrial plants, and the like. GasSecure’s clients include major oil companies and their products are in wide use around the globe.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The growing need to improve plant safety by installing more gas detectors and replacing out of date detection systems is driving the demand for wireless gas detectors, which have the added advantage of eliminating the need for wiring and thus are easier to install and cost less. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">As such, Yokogawa will be better able to satisfy its customers’ needs by incorporating wireless gas detectors in its field wireless system solutions. At the same time, GasSecure will be able to utilise Yokogawa’s global sales and service network to expand its wireless gas detector business.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Also, under the terms of a separate sales agreement that was reached in February of this year, GasSecure will sell Yokogawa’s field wireless system devices together with its own gas detection systems.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">GasSecure’s wireless gas detectors detect leaks of hydrocarbon gas that can cause explosions. Utilising ultra-low power infrared sensors, they perform measurements and send that information wirelessly to the host monitoring system.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">As gas leaks are a frequent cause of major plant accidents, it is very important to have a highly reliable gas detection system that keeps plant personnel constantly up to date on any changes in gas concentration levels. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">With a five-second response time, GasSecure’s wireless gas detectors are able to perform highly specific and reliable infrared measurements of gas concentrations and wirelessly update a host monitoring system.</p>
