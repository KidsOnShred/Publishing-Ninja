<p class="ui-droppable">While there are a variety of ways to measure this key parameter for serious riders, they typically use sensors affixed to pedals or the rear-wheel axis. The compact, ultra-light force sensor developed in this collaboration will be lighter, more precise and more easily integrated in the rear wheel, assuring reliable data in all types of weather and on all roads.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">“Corima has always worked with cycling professionals on both the track and road racing circuits, so we understand their needs for superior equipment and, increasingly, smart devices,” says Corima Managing Director Pierre-Jean Martin. “This force sensor developed with Leti and embedded on our carbon wheels is made with those athletes in mind and will raise the standard for measuring pedal force.”</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The project blends Leti’s experience in electronics, signal processing and wireless communication to transmit real-time information via the Internet of Things about the cyclist’s pedal force. Corima is modelling the distributions of effort in the wheel. The project is part of Leti’s Development and Prototyping Platform, whose goal is to help SMEs in traditional industries improve their products and develop competitive advantages by integrating sensors and communication systems in their products. It is funded through the Easytech program of the IRT Nanoelec research institute.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">“Leti’s strengths in microelectronics and sensors produce versatile devices that have many potential uses, and we constantly look for potential partners who have new applications for them,” Leti CEO Laurent Malier, concludes. “Working with Corima, our team came up with an innovative use for a force sensors that, when integrated in Corima’s carbon wheels, apply Leti technology in a new realm and support the quantify-self movement.”</p>
