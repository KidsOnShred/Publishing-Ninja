<p class="ui-droppable">The company has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with European-based EV Group (EVG), which specialises in bonding and material handling equipment.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The firms will work together in various collaborative arrangements including jointly developing high volume production processes and equipment necessary to bond the ultra-thin sapphire and SiC lamina, produced by GT’s Hyperion technology, to engineered substrates such as glass, silicon, and plastics.In addition, GT announced it will begin working with a leading glass substrate producer to develop specially engineered substrate materials that can be bonded to ultra-thin sapphire lamina to create unique composite solutions that expand the reach of sapphire into a broader set of applications.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The company also announced that it has acquired patent-pending technology for producing low-cost, scratch-resistant aluminium oxide coatings for various substrates including glass and plastics.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">These coatings are expected to provide some of the durability and scratch-resistant properties of crystalline sapphire at a lower price point to address market opportunities where cost is paramount and not all of the properties of sapphire are required.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">GT’s business model will be focused on selling the bonding and coating equipment developed through these initiatives.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">“Our sapphire composite material development program is focused on leveraging the combined expertise of GT and our technology partners in order to build a new market for low-cost and highly-durable substrate solutions for next generation consumer and industrial products,” says Tom Gutierrez, GT’s president and CEO. “These programs enhance our technology portfolio and leverage our significant investment in our Hyperion technology.”</p>
