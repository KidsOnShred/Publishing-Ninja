<p class="ui-droppable">In an attempt to enhance the energy efficiency of power drive systems, where AC drives already have a very high efficiency, much effort has been put on improving the energy efficiency of electric motors. Through the introduction of a classification system for motor energy efficiency, as introduced in the standard IEC60034-30, users are given a clear and easy framework for comparing motor efficiencies. With new higher efficiency classes being in the pipeline, it seems like users will also have to get used to considering alternative motor technologies to the somewhat classic induction motor. This paper takes a look at two of these alternatives. Both the synchronous reluctance motor and the permanent magnet motor are synchronous motors that offer good possibilities for improving system efficiency in variable speed drive applications, all at a reasonable cost.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Classification of motor efficiencies</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Power drive systems (PDS) consume a major share of the electricity produced and used globally. In order to put more focus on the efficiency of electric motors and power drive systems, the working groups of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have created a framework for measurement of classification of motor efficiencies with the standards IEC60034-2-1 “Standard methods for determining losses and efficiency from tests” and IEC60034-30-1 “Efficiency classes of line operated AC motors”. The standard IEC60034-30-1 (2008) defines the motor efficiency classes IE1 (standard efficiency), IE2 (high efficiency) and IE3 (premium efficiency) and efficiency limits for each class and motor size. Additionally, in the latest version of IEC60034-30-1 Ed 1.0, there is also a new class called IE4 (super premium efficiency).</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Classification of motors according to efficiency simplifies comparison of efficiency between different motors, as no consideration needs to be taken regarding the size of the motor which would be the case if direct efficiency numbers were to be compared. Today, there are only standards in place for line fed motors, whereas requirements for defining the extra motor losses, and thus the change of efficiency, for variable frequency drive (VFD) fed motors are not yet in place.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Upcoming versions of the IEC60034 family of standards are set to cover this aspect as well, but currently efficiencies given by motor manufacturers are not suitable for direct comparison of motor efficiencies in VSD applications. They will be included in IEC 60034-30-2.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) is also working on creating a framework for efficiency comparison of power drive systems through the standard EN50598 “Ecodesign for power drive systems, motor starters, power electronics and their driven applications”. The standard EN50598 will also give methods for defining efficiency of the PDS in a given application.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Motor technology change ahead</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">There will probably be a need to define higher efficiency classes than the current IE1 to IE3 (and recently added IE4). Higher efficiency classes, such as IE5, could be expected to require at least 15% better efficiency over the previous classes. According to data presented by the IEC, the energy efficiency improvement potential of the induction motor is competitive up to energy efficiency class IE3, but will be difficult to adapt to IE4 (and IE5) in a cost-efficient way as increasing efficiency in essence is achieved by reducing the I2R losses of the rotor by using copper bars and increasing surface areas.</p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-231" style="float: left; opacity: 1; width: 652.991452991453px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-231-2014-07-31.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 1 Efficiency classes according to IEC600034-30 for line fed motors</div></div><p class="ui-droppable" style=""><img src="file:///C:/Users/TOM~1.COV/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png" alt="Efficiency classes according to iec600034-30 for line fed motors"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Figure 1 Efficiency classes according to IEC600034-30 for line fed motors</p> <p class="ui-droppable">If the induction motor is hard to adapt to higher efficiency requirements, then what are the alternatives? It is very likely that the future is in the synchronous motor technology. This paper looks at two motor types that are already partly in use in certain applications: the permanent magnet motor (PMM) and the synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM). </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"> </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>THE SYNCHROUNOUS RELUCTANCE MOTOR</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) as a motor type has been known for almost a century. For reasons related to its lack of direct-on-line starting capability (although hybrid designs with line start capabilities are available), weak torque behaviour and lack of good solutions for variable frequency control, this motor technology initially did not reach any wider industrial use. Today, this motor technology has become interesting again thanks to improvement in rotor designs and modern cost-effective and commonly used variable speed drive (VSD) technology.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Functional principle</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">A typical SynRM is designed for 3-phase sinusoidal supply voltage with a stator design which is more or less the same as is used in and mass produced for induction motors.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The main technical difference is in the rotor design which, instead of a short circuited squirrel cage as used in the induction motor, is designed to achieve paths with high and low magnetic reluctance (reluctance for magnetic flux is analog to resistance for an electric current).</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The path with low magnetic reluctance is normally referred to as the d-axis (direct axis) whereas the corresponding path with high magnetic reluctance is referred to as the q-axis (quadrature axis).</p> <p class="ui-droppable">When a magnetic field is applied through the rotor from the motor stator, a torque is created as the rotor tries to align itself in the best flux conducting angle relative to the stator field. As the magnetic field in the stator is rotating with a rate in proportion to the applied stator frequency, the rotor will follow with a speed synchronised to the speed of the stator field. </p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-233" style="float: left; opacity: 1; width: 411.8226600985222px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-233-2014-07-31.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 2 Example of SRM rotor through-cut</div></div><p class="ui-droppable" style=""><img src="file:///C:/Users/TOM~1.COV/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png" alt="Example of srm rotor through-cut"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Figure 2 Example of SRM rotor through-cut</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The strength of the torque produced by the SynRM is directly proportional to the ratio of the inductance of the q- and d-axis. Most rotor designs available in the market today are rather simple laminated designs with air gaps in the q-axis direction to increase the reluctance. This gives a cost-effective and rather simple rotor design.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">In a static operation, no current is induced in the rotor which in turns keeps the rotor losses at a low level improving the motor efficiency compared to the induction motor. However, in order to magnetise the rotor, a reactive current is needed which in turn reduces the power factor of the motor compared to the induction motor.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Expect a higher nominal current</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The lower power factor of the SynRM increases the nominal current. The decrease in power factor is, however, to some extent compensated by the increase in efficiency, but still the motors available in the market today commonly have a higher nominal current than the corresponding induction motor. Partly the reason for the increased current can also be that the motors are designed for VSD operation and thus designed for a slightly lower nominal voltage than the line-voltage.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">For the motor user, the higher current of the motor has one major impact – the sizing of the VSD. As VSDs available in the market today have current ratings optimised for IMs, an oversizing of the VSD with one step seems typically to be required which in turn leads to a slight cost increase for the VSD. It is however to be noted that the higher motor current is not visible on the line side of the VSD. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>High efficiency</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">compared to an IM, although some increased stator losses due to the higher current are to be expected. Also data provided by motor manufacturers suggest the efficiency of currently available SynRMs is on a high level. It is however also to be noted that most motors are not run at full load constantly. Measurements suggest that the efficiency at partial loads can be even better than the efficiency of a corresponding permanent magnet motor (PMM).</p> <p class="ui-droppable">In applications which are run constantly, such as pumps and fans, the energy-saving potential that can be achieved by using high-efficiency motors is also typically the greatest. In many of these applications, VSDs are used already today for reasons related to process control and energy efficiency of the system and, due the quadratic torque behaviour of centrifugal pumps and fans, these are commonly used at partial load which underlines the importance of good motor efficiency at partial loads.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Support in VSDs to be created</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">As already stated, a SynRM cannot normally be started and run directly from the line. There are motors available in the market with integrated short-circuit bars in the rotor that allow the motor to be started as an induction motor directly from the line.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">For most applications, a VSD will always be needed. Currently, most general-purpose VSDs lack the control functionality needed to run SynRMs. This is likely to change in the future, and users interested in applying SRM should be in contact with their VSD supplier for more information about the availability of VSD support.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>THE PERMANENT MAGNET MOTOR</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The first permanent magnet motors were developed already in the 19th century. Due to the lack of good magnetic materials and the need for variable frequency control (although hybrid designs with line start capabilities are available), the motor technology did not get any larger scale industrial use initially. With the availability of new rare earth magnetic materials the torque/power density of permanent magnet motors has improved significantly. Today, permanent magnet motors are used in a wide range of industrial applications both as servo motors but also increasingly in normal VSD applications thanks to their high efficiency. A large portion of the motors used in the machine building sector are special designs that allow the designer to adapt the motor to the requirements of the driven load, for example to create gearless solutions.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Functional principle</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">There are several variants of permanent magnet motors such as brushless DC motors and servo motors. In this document, the focus is on looking at standard motors designed for VSD applications and thus permanent magnet motors suitable for 3-phase sinusoidal voltage supply. Such motors are often designed around a standard stator having the same characteristics as the stator of an induction motor. As with SynRMs, the main difference between the induction motor and PMM is in the design of the rotor. In PMMs, the rotor contains strong permanent magnets that create the magnet field that aligns with the magnetic field of the stator and thus is needed for creating torque on the motor shaft.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">As the magnets of the rotor will follow the magnetic field of the stator, the result is a synchronous motor. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-232" style="float: left; opacity: 1; width: 446.31578947368416px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-232-2014-07-31.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Figure 3 Permanent magnet motor through-cut</div></div><p class="ui-droppable" style=""><img src="file:///C:/Users/TOM~1.COV/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.jpg" alt="Permanent magnet motor through-cut"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Figure 3 Permanent magnet motor through-cut</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"> </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>High efficiency at all speeds</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Due to the nature of the rotor being magnetised with permanent magnets, there is no actual current flow in the rotor like in the induction motor and thus also no I2R losses/slip losses occurring in the rotor. This fact results in increased efficiency of the motor. The power remains high over the whole speed range and can, with the help of an adequate drive control, be kept close to unity which in turn also minimises the I2R losses occurring in the stator windings. A high portion of the motors used today are used with partial load and/or partial speed – an area where the permanent motor efficiency difference is high compared to the induction motor.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Slow rotating high pole IMs usually have a rather low power factor and lower efficiency due to the less efficient magnetisation of the rotor at low speeds of the magnet field. This increases the nominal current and makes the motor less suitable for gearless applications.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Permanent magnet motors do not have this behaviour and can be designed with a high number of poles without loss of efficiency. In applications where mechanical gears can be saved, both cost and efficiency gains are achieved. Also high-speed permanent magnet motors can be created with a minimum loss of efficiency.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Permanent magnets</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The amount of torque that can be produced by a permanent magnet motor directly links to the strength of the magnets and, for this reason; it is of key importance to use strong magnets. Rare earth magnetic material, such as neodymium, is used in the magnets. In recent years, the price of these materials has greatly fluctuated which can be a limiting factor for the growth of this technology on a wider basis until supply and demand of the materials is in balance.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>VSD support is largely there</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable" style="">The permanent magnet motors have been actively used on a wider basis for a longer period of time. For this reason, modern VSDs normally offer at least basic support for permanent magnet motors. This makes the step easier for motor users that want to move to this motor technology, as a wide selection of VSDs are available that support at least less demanding applications such as pumps and fans. For demanding applications and for special high pole and direct-drive types of applications, the amount of VSDs with support for this kind of use is clearly lower.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>COMPARING MOTOR EFFICIENCIES</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable" style="">In order to compare motor efficiencies, there are several parameters that need to be considered. Most significant is that PMM and SynRM motors require a variable speed drive which produces a voltage pattern to the motor that is not fully sinusoidal and which thus creates additional motor losses. On the other hand, most IM motor efficiency data is given for fixed sinusoidal 50/60Hz supplies. Today, there is not yet a full standardised framework in place for comparison of motor efficiencies which makes the comparison technically quite demanding. There is, probably due to reasons mentioned above, a quite limited amount of measurement data that would allow a direct comparison of motors of different technologies.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Application specific efficiencies</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">When comparing motor or drive+motor efficiencies, it is also important to consider the behaviour of the load in the actual application for which the motor is to be used. For example, in centrifugal pumps and fans, the power need varies in cubic to the speed which means that efficiency at partial load is very strongly linked to the total efficiency of the installation.<strong></strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>PMM vs SynRM</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable" style="">Laboratory measurements conducted at the University of Beira Interior in Portugal on commercially available 2.2 kW motors indicate that the motor efficiency in quadratic load applications of both PMSM and SynRM motors are reaching efficiencies close to 90% in VSD operation, which is a good value compared to the 87% IE3 efficiency limit currently defined for line supply.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">As can be seen from the graph below, the reluctance motor appears to be extremely competitive in the low speed area.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-234" style="float: left; opacity: 1; width: 447.13375796178343px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-234-2014-07-31.jpg"></div><p class="ui-droppable" style=""><img src="file:///C:/Users/TOM~1.COV/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.png" alt="Efficiency comparison pmm vs synrm as function of speed with quadratic load curve"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">Figure 4 Efficiency comparison PMM vs SynRM as function of speed with quadratic load curve</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>A CHANGE IS COMING?</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">This paper gives an introduction to two motor types that in many applications already today could compete both in cost and efficiency with the traditional induction motor – still these motors are apparently sold in rather small quantities. What is missing and what is still needed for these motors to get into mainstream use? The topics below are some of the points that affect how fast these motors will gain ground and how fast and to what extent the transition away from the induction motor will happen.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Availability of new motor technology</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">In order for new motor technologies to become an alternative for many users, there have to be motors available from many of the main suppliers. Many users are tied to a certain supplier because of reasons related to total purchase, service and support, logistics reasons, personal relations, or other reasons that makes the step of changing supplier large in case the existing motor supplier is not capable of supplying motors of the new technology.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>VSD support for new motor technology</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The two motor technologies discussed in this text are both synchronous motors requiring a VSD on order to be operated. Especially the support for reluctance motors in standard VSDs is rather limited, and this can currently be seen as a limiting factor.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Legislation Efficiency requirements</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">As already initially stated, one of the main drives for the introduction of new motor technologies is coming from energy efficiency legislation and marking initiatives that highlight and put emphasis on energy efficiency as a decision-making criterion. These initiatives can be directly motor related, but also very often machine-specific requirements.</p> <p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Compatibility aspects</strong></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The new motor technologies are interesting motors from a theoretical point of view. However, when used in real world applications, many more aspects need to be considered. Backward compatibility, both mechanical and electrical with existing installations, has to be ensured. Replacing IMs with new motor technologies requires a higher level of understanding on how the behaviour of the motor technologies differs and how the system is to be designed for optimum performance.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">In this field, the motor and drives industry has a future challenge in training the users in making the transition from IM to new motor technologies. The change is likely to come – the pace of change is what still remains for everybody to be experienced.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Sources:</p> <p class="ui-droppable">[1] Energy Efficiency Factsheet, Gilbert A.
