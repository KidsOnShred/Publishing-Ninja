<p class="ui-droppable">Sumitomo Electric Device Innovations, Inc. (SEDI), Japan, has ordered an Aixtron CRIUS MOCVD system to be delivered with 4-inch wafer configuration. The reactor will be used to boost production of GaN on SiC devices for RF data transfer applications. The purchase was made in the first quarter of 2014 for delivery at SEDIâ€™s Electron Devices Division in Yokohama in the third quarter. SEDI is preparing for a ramp-up in demand expected to begin in 2015 and chose the Aixtron system due to its reputation for 4-inch wafer uniformity and precise process control, which is especially important for device production on cost-intensive SiC wafers. The new reactor will be equipped with optional features such as dynamic gap adjustment, ARGUS in-situ temperature control, and EpiCurve TT metrology system. The ARGUS monitoring device provides full wafer mapping in real time for optimum control of the growth process. Extended flexibility is enabled by allowing the adjustment of the process gap between the showerhead and the substrate.</p><div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-402" style="opacity: 1; float: none; width: 537.931034482759px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.publishing.ninja/publisher/content/img/image-19-402-2014-09-22.jpg"></div><p class="ui-droppable"><br></p>
