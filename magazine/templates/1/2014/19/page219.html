<p class="ui-droppable">Power electronics covers a multitude of application areas that few industries can match. With applications and voltage ranging from a few volts to a few thousands volts, power electronics and its related supply chain has global significance.</p><p class="ui-droppable"><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">The power electronics industry has great growth potential, (production, distribution, and consumption) but the industry has diversified and there have been significant changes and disruption to the established value chain.</span></p><div><pclass="p1"><p class="ui-droppable">The recent power revolution started with emerging materials which are better suited to handle the latest critical power challenges. Advanced wide band-gap semiconductors such as SiC and GaN offer many advantages to power electronics and systems designers but change comes at a price to the value chain and will significantly change the way the power electronic industry develops.</p><p class="ui-droppable">Power Electronics World (PEW) will be the only global title and website covering the developments across the whole supply chain through news, reviews, analysis and application stories. No other title exists to meet the needs of the world wide power electronics value chain. This issue we have Toshiba Electronics Europeâ€™ view on a SiC hybrid approach to inverters (page 3) CREE asks is this the transistor that could trigger a telecoms industry shift from silicon to GaN? (page 4) and the EV Group will discuss why versatility is essential for high-efficiency power devices. (page 8 )</p><p class="ui-droppable">PEW will use next generation publishing tools and address specifically the tablet and laptop users in HTML 5. This is another first for the industry and a next generation step for publishing.</p><p class="ui-droppable">We look forward to working with you.</p><p class="ui-droppable">Jackie Cannon</p><p class="ui-droppable"><i>Publisher</i></p><h2>Contacts</h2><div><h2>Director of Power Electronics Publishing</h2><p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Jackie Cannon</strong><br><a href="mailto:jackie.cannon@angelbc.com">jackie.cannon@angelbc.com</a><br>+44 (0)1923 690205</p><h2>Sales</h2><p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Shehzad Munshi</strong><br><a href="mailto:shehzad.munshi@angelbc.com">shehzad.munshi@angelbc.com</a><br>+44 (0)1923 690215<br><br><strong>Robin Halder</strong><br><a href="mailto:robin.halder@angelbc.com">robin.halder@angelbc.com</a><br>+44 (0)2476 718979</p><h2>Chief Operating Officer</h2><p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Stephen Whitehurst</strong><br><a href="mailto:stephen.whitehurst@angelbc.com">stephen.whitehurst@angelbc.com</a><br>+44 (0)2476 718970</p><h2>US Advertising Sales Account Managers</h2><p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Tom Brun</strong><br><a href="mailto:tbrun@brunmedia.com">tbrun@brunmedia.com</a><br>724-539-2404<br>724-539-2406</p><p class="ui-droppable"><strong>Janice Jenkins</strong><br><a href="mailto: jjenkins@brunmedia.com">jjenkins@brunmedia.com</a><br>724-929-3550<br>724-929-3137</p></div></pclass="p1"></div>
