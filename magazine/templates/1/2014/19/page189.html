<p>Infineon is beginning to reap the fruits of 300-millimeter thin-wafer technology for power semiconductors, enabling it to achieve growth with a substantially lower level of capital employed compared with 200-millimeter wafers. The level of investments required to increase manufacturing capacities for power semiconductors in order to achieve the targeted growth rate is therefore decreasing.</p> <p>Infineon is also in the early stages of a growth curve for products manufactured using standard-CMOS-based technologies with 65-nanometer and lower process structures. Unlike with power semiconductors, these technologies do not entail any major differentiating features from a manufacturing perspective and, as a result, Infineon intends to outsource the relevant production volumes to contract manufacturers, thus obviating the need in future to invest in in-house facilities to process these wafers.</p> <p>The Company intends to allocate a greater share of backend manufacturing to subcontractors for those package types that offer no meaningful differentiation. Similarly, unlike in-house production, this will not involve any investment.</p> <p>Great strides have been made over the course of the 2014 fiscal year to date to improve both current and future productivity by means of a whole raft of measures implemented in conjunction with a dedicated productivity improvement program. This enables higher production volumes for a given amount of capital investment.</p> <p>A detailed analysis of the medium- to long-term impact of these factors, undertaken as part of the annual planning process, showed that the target ratio for investments to revenue can be reduced in future fiscal years by 2 percentage points to an average of about 13 percent over the cycle.</p> <p>In view of the expected sustainable improvement in free cash flow, it is planned to increase the dividend significantly from as early as the current financial year. Subject to there being an appropriate level of unappropriated profit available for distribution and the corresponding resolutions being taken by Infineon's representative bodies, the aim is to increase the dividend by between four and six cents.</p> <p>"Infineon is determined to ensure excellent product availability and to grow faster than its competitors. The fact that we will need to employ less capital in future to achieve this, clearly demonstrates that we are on the right track with our manufacturing strategy", stated Dr. Reinhard Ploss, CEO of Infineon Technologies AG. "It is justified that shareholders should also now benefit from the progress made. Therefore it is our intention to raise the dividend significantly for the current fiscal year."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Amantys Power Drive extends protection capabilities for High Power Modules</p> <p>Amantys announced at PCIM Europe 2014 in Nuremberg the launch of a new Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) Gate Driver operating at 3.3kV, 4.5kV and 6.5kV, with improved reliability and protection in high power modules targeting applications including wind turbines, locomotive, HVDC, and industrial drives. </p> <p>The product family offers a range of innovative protection mechanisms vital for these high power applications, combined with Amantys Power Insight in a ‘plug and play’ format.</p> <p>At these power levels the gate driver must provide reliable and effective protection mechanisms for a variety of fault conditions. This new Amantys IGBT gate driver includes a variety of detection mechanisms for different short circuit types including a multi-threshold, programmable comparator which can identify slowly increasing fault currents, a fault mechanism which is not commonly detected in commercially available “plug and play” gate drivers. Once a fault is detected the driver is designed to implement a controlled switch off of the IGBT avoiding the potential for damaging voltage spikes.</p> <p>This gate driver also includes the Amantys Power Insight condition monitoring and configuration capability to observe and report on critical power switching characteristics as well as enabling in-system configuration of the driver. Designed for the “intelligent control of power”, the Amantys Power Drive is fully integrated and can measure and export critical performance parameters during operation as well as allowing configuration over the existing optical PWM and fault interfaces. These capabilities greatly simplify the design-in process.</p> <p>The new Amantys Power Drive gate drive operates at voltages from 3300V up to 6500V and is configurable for industry standard 190mm x 130mm high isolation power modules from manufacturers including ABB, Dynex, Hitachi, Infineon, and Mitsubishi.</p> <p>Commenting on this announcement, Steve Evans, VP of Marketing at Amantys said: “With its extensive protection capabilities, this series of IGBT gate drivers enable customers to design increasingly capable protection into their system, making their products more reliable and resilient than ever. In addition the Amantys Power Insight capability provides the unique capability to observe and tune system performance at each stage of development, as well as through equipment commissioning and into operation.</p> “Today’s global launch of the new high voltage range of IGBT Gate Drivers gives our new global distribution partners an even broader range of IGBT Drivers – the only family of gate drives to include Amantys Power Insight for IGBT Modules from 1.2kV to 6.5kV. There is already significant interest in this product for applications including wind turbine inverters, industrial drives, HVDC transmission and locomotive traction inverters.”
