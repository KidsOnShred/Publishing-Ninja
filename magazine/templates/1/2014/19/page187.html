<p class="ui-droppable">Toshiba Corporation has announced that it will expand its family of 650V silicon carbide (SiC) schottky barrier diodes (SBD) with the addition of insulated TO-220F-2L package products. The 4 new products expand the 6A, 8A, 10A and 12A line-up from the current TO-220-2L package products. Mass production shipment starts immediate.ly.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">SBDs are suited for applications including server power supplies and power conditioners for photovoltaic power generation systems. SBDs can also act as replacements for silicon diodes in switching power supplies, where they are 50% more efficient (Toshiba survey).</p> SiC power devices offer more stable operation than current silicon devices - even at high voltages and currents - as they significantly reduce heat dissipation during operation. They meet diverse industry needs for smaller, more effective communications devices and suit industrial applications ranging from servers to inverters.
