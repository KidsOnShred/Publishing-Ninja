<p class="ui-droppable">Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. (TAEC) has announced two new additions to its TCR3D series of 300mA single output CMOS-LDO regulator ICs. </p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p> <p class="ui-droppable">The new TCR3DMxx is housed in a small DFN4 (1.0×1.0×0.58mm) package; and the TCR3DFxx comes in a general purpose SMV(SOT-25)(2.8×2.9×1.1mm) package. Both feature low drop-out voltage, low output noise voltage and a built-in low inrush current reduction circuit.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Toshiba offers more than 40 products with a fixed output voltage ranging from 1.0 to 4.5V to accommodate various applications, including smart phones, tablet PCs, portable audio players, digital cameras, game consoles and other small mobile devices.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">CMOS-LDO regulators enable a low profile, low supply current and low dropout, making them a popular power management choice for mobile devices. </p> <p class="ui-droppable">Toshiba's micro CMOS process helps the regulators improve the tradeoff between characteristics and size. A small package size makes the new LDO regulators suitable for applications requiring high-density packaging, such as portable devices.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Features</p> <p class="ui-droppable"></p><ul><li>Low drop-out voltage: VIN-VOUT = 490mV (typ.) at 1.2 V-output, IOUT = 300mA</li><li>Low output noise voltage: (VNO = 38μVrms (typ.) at 2.5V output, IOUT = 10mA, 10Hz ≤ f ≤ 100kHz)</li><li>Wide range output voltage line-ups: (Configurable in a range from 1.0 to 4.5V in steps of 50mV)</li><li>Built-in inrush current reduction circuit</li><li>Over current protection</li><li>Thermal shut down function</li><li>Built-in output auto-discharge function</li><li>Pull down connection between CONTROL and GND</li><li>Small package: DFN4 (1.0x1.0x0.58mm), SMV(SOT-25)(2.8x2.9x1.1mm)</li></ul><p class="ui-droppable"></p>
