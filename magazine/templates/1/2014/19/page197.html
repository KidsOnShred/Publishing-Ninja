<p class="ui-droppable">Microchip Technology Inc has announced <a></a>a new family of USB power delivery (UPD) controllers—the UPD100X with an industry-standard power delivery and battery charging protocol. A single USB cable can be used for data, and simultaneously can deliver up to 100W of power from a single standard USB port which is 40 times the power compared to USB 2.0. With up to 100W of available power, designers can dynamically allocate this power to fast battery charging and system power.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The UPD1001 is the first of the family and is a highly flexible and configurable solution that supports the 5 USB-IF standard UPD power profiles plus an additional 25 UPD-compliant profiles for a total of 30 profiles supported by a single chip. This will allow designers to select the optimum power profiles in order to meet their specific application requirements. Simple configuration is achieved by strapping the two configuration select pins on the UPD1001. A multitude of configurations are available to provide utmost flexibility. Integrated quad-banks of one-time programmable memory allow for further system customization without the need of any external memory components.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The UPD100X family serves a wide range of applications in the consumer (e.g., notebooks, printers and accessories, docking stations, mobile devices and battery chargers), industrial (computers and handheld devices) and automotive markets (e.g., head units, break-out boxes and USB battery chargers), among others. </p> <p class="ui-droppable">“Today’s announcement of the UPD100X family of products shows Microchip’s continued support of the ever improving USB ecosystem,” said Mitch Obolsky, vice president of Microchip’s USB and Networking Group. “The ability to deliver 100W of power, while transmitting USB data, creates a single cable of connectivity for all consumer products. Microchip is pleased to be a leader in power delivery and is committed to improving the consumer’s entire USB experience.”</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Development Support</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The UPD1001 is supported by Microchip’s UPD1001 Evaluation Kit (part # EVB-UPD1001, $299.00), and is available today through Microchip sales offices.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Pricing &amp; Availability</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The UPD1001 devices are available now for sampling in 32-pin QFN and 28-pin TSSOP for $1.15 each, in 10,000-unit quantities. Volume production for these devices is expected in July.</p>
