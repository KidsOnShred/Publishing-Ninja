The PQFN package features extended lead with end-lead plating to ensure effective solder-ability and an easy-to-inspect solder joint.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">“The AUIRFN8403 offers more than a 50% size reduction compared with conventional DPAK (TO-252) packages, and offers significant thermal performance improvement compared to an SO-8 package to provide a cost effective ultra-compact, high efficiency, high density solution for automotive applications,” said Jifeng Qin, Product Manager, Automotive MOSFETs, IR’s Automotive Products Business Unit.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">IR’s automotive MOSFETs are subject to dynamic and static part average testing combined with 100 percent automated wafer level visual inspection as part of IR’s automotive quality initiative targeting zero defects. AEC-Q101 qualification requires that there is no more than a 20 percent change in Rds(on) after 1,000 temperature cycles of testing.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The new device is qualified according to AEC-Q101 standards, features an environmentally friendly, lead-free and RoHS compliant bill of materials.</p>
