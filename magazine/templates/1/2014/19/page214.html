Once again we are pushing the boundaries of solid-state power amplifier technology with an extremely compact solution.”</p><p class="ui-droppable">The amplifier designs are flexible in layout and architecture, and are fully customisable to meet individual specifications for electrical, mechanical and environmental parameters. Amplifiers with pulsed power outputs in excess of 1kW, and with multi-octave performance are also under development.</p>
