The ISL8240M is also capable of delivering up to 240A output when six modules in parallel operation are current shared, enabling the industry’s highest total output current.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Intersil claims the ISL8240M, which uses the firm's patented technology and packaging techniques, delivers greater than 90 percent power efficiency and has one of the best thermal de-rating performances in the industry, enabling the device to operate at full power over a wide temperature range.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The module also provides over-temperature, over-current and over-voltage protection, further enhancing the robustness and reliability of the solution.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">Like all of Intersil’s power modules, the ISL8240M is a turnkey solution that requires minimal design since only six external passive parts are required. The ISL8240M fits in a compact 17mm x 17mm footprint. Excellent thermal performance eliminates the need for heat sinks, further streamlining power supply design and reducing design and manufacturing risk and increasing reliability.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">“The demands on power supplies continue to increase, making every efficiency gain and savings in board-space critical in enabling customers to achieve their design objectives,” says Mark Downing, senior vice president of infrastructure and industrial power products at Intersil. “The ISL8240M complements our family of 30A module solutions, giving designers more flexibility while offering all of the power savings and high level of reliability customers have come to expect from our solutions.”</p>
