<p class="ui-droppable">Northrop Grumman Corporation has introduced two new high power GaN monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) power amplifiers for Ka-band satellite communication terminals and point-to-point digital communication links.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The APN228 and APN229 power amplifiers were developed with the company's proprietary GaN high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) power process and provide saturated output power of 13 and 8 watts, respectively. These second-generation power amplifiers offer one of the highest power densities of any existing Ka-band GaN product on the market.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">The broadband, two-stage amplifiers operate from 27 to 31 GHz, and, when integrated in high efficiency solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs), allow for higher data rate in communication systems.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">"GaN-based SSPAs are a far more desirable solution to costly travelling-wave tubes which require more complex, higher voltage power supplies and a lengthier production time," says Frank Kropschot, general manager, Microelectronics Products and Services, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems.</p> <p class="ui-droppable">"APN228 and APN229 will allow our customers to reduce the cost and complexity of power-combining, and offer a significant cost advantage compared to the current generation of Ka-band products," he adds. </p><p class="ui-droppable">APN228:</p><div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-267" style="float: left; opacity: 1; width: 328.5882352941177px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-267-2014-07-31.jpg"></div><p class="ui-droppable" style="">The APN228 is a 16.0 mm2 GaN HEMT MMIC PA provides 19.5 dB of linear gain, 41.2 dBm (13 W) of saturated output power and Power Added Efficiency (PAE) greater than 27 percent. It is suitable for next generation high power and efficiency SSPAs for commercial and military satellite applications.</p><div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-268" style="float: right; opacity: 1; width: 294.8837209302325px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-268-2014-07-31.jpg"></div><p class="ui-droppable" style="">APN229:</p><p class="ui-droppable" style="">The APN229 is a 7.41 mm2 GaN HEMT power amplifier that provides 20 dB of linear gain, 39 dBm (8 W) of saturated output power and PAE greater than 30 percent. It is also a complimentary driver amplifier to the APN228.</p><p class="ui-droppable">Samples of these MMIC power amplifiers will be available by mid-July, and packaged versions will be available for sampling later this year.</p>
