As of today, energy loss between the power source or power plant and the end user regularly exceeds 50%. In other words, at least half of the produced electricity is wasted in conversion and distribution in power grids. On the consumer side, about one third of the electric energy is used for motor and electric drive applications. Efficient and smart conversion, in combination with variable speed drives, can enable significant energy savings. The same energy loss problem applies to lighting. Although light emitting diodes (LED) produce light with very high efficacy, conversion from grid voltage and frequency to required static low voltage for proper LED operation leads to losses. Data centers and base stations also can benefit from reduced conversion losses and more efficient cooling. Data centers alone account for the same carbon footprint as the worldwide aviation industry. Consequently, the market size for advanced silicon power devices is growing at a compound annual growth rate of about 11%, as has been reported by Yole Developpement in May 2013. </p> <p></p> <p>Power devices have historically been seen as followers of memory and logic CMOS with respect to patterning technology nodes and manufacturing processes. This has been true especially for the early generations of silicon power devices. The adoption of sub-micron patterning resolution marked a major first step in performance increase, where gate design for aninsulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) was still planar. However, scaling does not introduce the same benefits for power devices as it does for memory or logic. In the last decade, power devices underwent tremendous development steps that differentiated it from the IC industry. For example, new process technologies, such as deep trench etching and super junction architectures, have enabled novel power device generations with reduced switching losses and conduction resistance. These trench-/field-stop or soft-punch-through architectures, to use the nomenclature from two leading IGBT manufacturers, only describe the functionality of the gate and respective current conduction characteristics. </p> <p></p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-292" style="float: left; opacity: 1; width: 767.3469387755102px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-292-2014-08-20.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Overview of EVG’s open adhesive platform relevant for advanced power device processing</div></div><p>Another enabling process, which is often underestimated for advanced power devices, is wafer thinning. By thinning the wafer, one can lower the on-resistance without changing the blocking voltage of the silicon wafer itself. Interestingly, thin-wafer processing has a greater impact on future performance gains for power devices than advances in front-side processing. The gate structures have already been optimized for years. Adding device performance there would add considerable process complexity and cost. On the other hand, thin-wafer processing enables on-resistance optimization of power devices much more easily than changing device doping levels and carrier distribution. One essential lever to optimizing power devices is the reduction of the ON resistance R<sub>DSon</sub>, a series connection in the final device structure. Here, the channel resistance and the drift zone resistance are specific to the power device design, where further improvements are difficult to achieve. The third-series resistance in this simplified circuit, the substrate resistance is most attractive to optimize. Since the current path is vertical in high-power devices, lowering the length of the current path reduces the resistance. In this case, shortening the current path is equivalent to wafer thinning. </p> <p></p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-293" style="float: right; opacity: 1; width: 550px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-293-2014-08-20.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">Interferometry and surface acoustic microscopy characterization of a 300mm silicon wafer, showing the total thickness evolution before and after grinding (in collaboration with LETI)</div></div><p>As wafers become thinner, they are increasingly prone to cracking or warping, and more difficult to handle during processing. One solution to address this is to bond the thinned wafers to a support carrier. For consumer applications, typical chip thicknesses range from 70µm down to 50µm for 1200V and 600V device classes, respectively. A look at different roadmaps of IGBT and other power device manufacturers reveals a further reduction of silicon thickness to as low as 20µm until 2020. </p> <p></p> <p>This article reviews the essentials of temporary bonding and debonding for thin-wafer processing of power devices, as well as practical considerations for implementation. As mentioned above, a simplified resistance network identifies the substrate resistance as a major contributor to total device resistance, which is directly related to the wafer thickness. Accordingly, temporary bonding process results are directly linked to device performance. Having a stable temporary bonding process is inevitable for thinning power devices to a minimum thickness while still achieving optimal device yield with minimum spread in performance.Any excess to the final device thickness results in increased forward saturation voltage as well as higher switching losses. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>IGBT thin-wafer processing</strong></p> <p>Figure 1 provides an overview of process steps for the implementation of thin-wafer processing of power devices. A critical step is the implantation and annealing of the backside emitter structure. Typical annealing processes run at a temperature of 420°C for about one hour to activate the dopants. This also marks the most critical step for the temporary bonded carrier system. However, most of the temporary bonding adhesives are not designed for temperatures higher than 250°C. Power device manufacturers have established different process flows to enable the use of standard temporary bonding adhesives while still annealing at more than 400°C. We review two different implementation process flows, namely temporary bonded TAIKO wafers and laser annealing of temporary bonded wafers.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>Figure 1 depicts a very simplified backside process flow for power devices. Starting with the front-side finished silicon wafer, the temporary bonding adhesive is spin coated and the device wafer is bonded to a carrier wafer. Next, the TAIKO back-grinding process is implemented (solid wafer rim stabilizing the thin wafer membrane) followed by plasma etching of the damaged surface to reduce the grinding strain. The back-side processing features two essential steps: ion implantation and metal deposition. In the next step, the TAIKO wafer is debonded and annealed in an external furnace to activate the implanted dopants. This first implementation option for temporary bonding separates thin-wafer processing on a temporary carrier from the final emitter annealing. </p> <p></p> <div class="img-default ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled" id="img-296" style="float: left; opacity: 1; width: 602.9629629629629px; top: auto; left: auto; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="http://www.angel-test.net/publisher/content/img/image-19-296-2014-08-20.jpg"><div class="img-caption" id="#caption-edit">EVG® 850 XT Temporary Bonding and Debonding Equipment: The modular equipment platform enables customer and process specific tool optimization.</div></div><p>Although TAIKO wafers are already established for high blocking voltage classes, where final device thicknesses are higher than 120µm. However, the combination of TAIKO wafers with temporary bonding technology lifts most process restrictions and uses the benefits of both thin wafer handling technologies. TAIKO grinding occurs during the same step as wafer thinning, where the inner wafer region is ground to the final device thickness, while a stabilizing thick-edge region is left to stiffen the membrane (similar to a drum). Grinding tape is used to protect the wafer front side from debris and particles, and to stabilize the wafers. However, peeling the tape after grinding exerts force that can lead to breakage for low silicon thicknesses. TAIKO also challenges backside processing equipment since robot end effectors or standard loading pins would perforate the thin wafer. This means equipment cannot be shared for both front-side and backside processing. Furthermore, as the wafer front-side is not protected for TAIKO wafers, delicate structures are in direct contact with wafer chucks/handlers and support parts of the equipment as backside processing is done. TAIKO also shows process feasibility to about 120µm final device thickness, which only apply to a minimum device class of 1200V. The depicted combined process flow for temporary bonding and TAIKO introduces more process versatility, and enables the use of state-of-the-art process equipment without highly adapted TAIKO wafer handling.</p> <p></p> <p>Another solution to temporary bonded thin wafers with high-temperature annealing is the implementation of pulsed laser annealing. Figure 1 also shows two different processes involving laser annealing (lower middle and right). In the lower middle flow, silicon carriers are used as a carrier. This means thermoplastic or thermoset adhesives are used for temporary bonding. In the lower right flow, transparent glass carriers are used as a handling carrier, enabling inspection and a final debonding by UV laser [1].After standard processing of the power device wafer and subsequent mounting to any carrier wafer, the wafer is thinned and strain is released by plasma etching. The back-side emitter and field-stop layer are then implanted. </p> <p></p> <p>The main difference between alternative process flows is the novel laser annealing step.Pulsed laser annealing (with short duration in the range of 600ns to 1.2μs) allows the achievement of required process temperatures on the exposed surface while simultaneously avoiding excess temperature levels on the temporary bonding interface. The front side can be fully processed, including metal contacts, and the back side is annealed with pulsed laser radiation afterwards. The short pulses keep the temperature on the front side low and the metal contacts intact. Generally, laser annealing operates at temperatures close to the melting point of silicon, which is needed for high diffusion and activation speeds with short laser pulses. In this way, annealing depths of up to 2µm can be achieved. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>EVG’s temporary bonding solutions </strong></p> <p>Temporary bonding can be divided into several different processes and mechanisms. Generally, the debonding mechanism is used as a differentiator. EVG’s open adhesive platform enables the processing of most available temporary bonding adhesives. Figure 2 depicts available debonding mechanisms. Power device process schemes do not significantly increase the high-temperature requirements for the adhesive system. Total thickness variations post-bond and post-grind carry higher importance. </p> <p></p> <p>As a result, thermoplastic adhesives used for slide-off debonding as well as ZoneBond® debonding offer sufficient process window for power devices. Thermoplastic adhesives offer the advantage of allowing for solvent cleaning after debonding in order to remove adhesive residues. Thermoplastic adhesives are also ideally suited for grinding since they are highly rigid at room temperature. For this reason, thermoplastic adhesives offer significant advantages in terms of cleanliness of the product wafer post-debond and quality of wafer thinning due to the rigid support they can provide at room temperature. On the other hand, thermoplastics become soft when heated, since their viscosity drops along a given rheology curve, which may represent a limitation for certain applications. Nevertheless, this drop in viscosity is leveraged in the bonding operation to establish reliable bonding. The adverse effect of the drop in viscosity at elevated temperatures can be mitigated by using different adhesives for different applications.</p> <p></p> <p>Besides chemical and thermal debonding of thermoplastic adhesives, different adhesive multi-layers offer mechanical debonding capabilities. In this case, thermoset materials and thermoplastic adhesive can be used. Thermoset means the materials are liquid after application, and become crosslinked or cured when subjected to heat. Silicone elastomers are a typical example. Such multi-layer adhesive stacks demand more engineering in an initial phase, since several layers are sequentially applied. Similar to ZoneBond®, different anti-sticking layers can be applied to tune the adhesion between wafers and, in turn, tune the bonding energy between the device and the carrier wafer. </p> <p></p> <p>The last debonding mechanism available within EVG’s open adhesive platform is laser debonding. Different available adhesives offer a strong absorption co-efficient with ultraviolet wavelengths. This strong absorption leads to a very abrupt absorption of the laser fluence at the interface to the carrier. Typically, the nanosecond-long laser pulse emitted by an excimer laser leads to a material decomposition within a few hundred nanometers from the interface. The gaseous decomposition products lift the thin wafer from the carrier, which leads to an easy debonding [1].</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3 shows thickness maps of a 300-mm silicon wafer prior to grinding with a total thickness variation (TTV) of 1.8µm. The added TTV from the grinding is only 400nm resulting in an excellent TTV of 2.2µm after grinding. </p> <p></p> <p>Figure 4 shows the EVG850XT temporary bonding and debonding system. The system is based on EVGs XT-frame, which is optimized for high-volume operation, reliability and uptime. This means the temporary bonder as well as the debonder rely on the same field proven modular platform. As a result of the modular design, the system can be fully customized to customer requirements, and changes or upgrades in the field can be done. </p> <p></p> <p>In conclusion, temporary bonding is an inevitable process step for the fabrication of advanced power devices. Controlling the silicon thickness ultimately determines device performance. EVG temporary bonding and debonding technology is highly versatile to meet different customer requirements and integration schemes for advanced silicon power device manufacturing.</p><p><br></p> <p><u>Reference:</u></p> <p>[1] T.
