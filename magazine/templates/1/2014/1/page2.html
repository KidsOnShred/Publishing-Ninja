<p><img src="http://www.powerelectronicsworld.net/magazine/images/power.jpg"><br></p><p>Power electronics covers a multitude of application areas that few industries can match. With applications and voltage ranging from a few volts to a few thousands volts, power electronics and its related supply chain has global significance.</p><p>The power electronics industry has great growth potential, (production, distribution, and consumption) but the industry has diversified and there have been significant changes and disruption to the established value chain.</p><p>The recent power revolution started with emerging materials which are better suited to handle the latest critical power challenges. Advanced wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC and GaN offer many advantages to power electronics and systems designers. But change comes at a price to the value chain and will significantly change the way the power electronic industry develops.</p><p>Power Electronics World (PEW) will be the only global title and website covering the developments across the whole supply chain through news, reviews, analysis and application stories. No other title exists to meet the needs of the world wide power electronics value chain.</p><p>PEW will use next generation publishing tools and present specifically to the tablet and laptop users in HTML 5. This will be another first for the industry and a next generation step for publishing.</p><p>With a portfolio that crosses the semiconductor and solar industries we have the experience and reach that will allow us to make PEW the&nbsp;go to&nbsp;product for 2014. Look out for our Awards programme and conference in the coming months.</p><p>We look forward to working with you.</p><p>Jackie Cannon<br>Publisher</p><p>Just a test</p><p><br> <br> </p><p>Testing</p>
