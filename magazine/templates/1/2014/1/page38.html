<div>Friday 28th February 2014</div>Craic<br /> Technologies, an innovator of UV-visible-NIR microanalysis solutions, <br /> is introducing Craic FilmPro film thickness measurement software.&nbsp;<br> <br><br /> This software package is designed to plug-in to Craic Technologyâ€™s <br /> microspectrophotometers and their controlling Lambdafire software.&nbsp; <br /> Craic FilmPro allows the user to measure the thickness of thin films <br /> rapidly and non-destructively.&nbsp;<br> <br> Able to analyse films of many <br /> materials on both transparent and opaque substrates, Craic FilmPro <br /> enables the user to determine thin film thickness on everything from <br /> semiconductors, MEMS devices, disk drives to flat panel displays. The <br /> software can be used in many different fields and in everything from <br /> research to industrial settings.<br> <br> <strong>Film Thickness Mapping</strong><br> <br><br /> "Many of our customers want to measure the thickness of thin films of <br /> smaller and smaller sampling areas for rapid quality control of their <br /> products. Craic FilmPro is a plug-in module that can be added to a Craic<br /> Technologies microspectrophotometer to enable this capability. This <br /> software was built in response to customer requests for a powerful, <br /> flexible film thickness tool that can measure sub-micron areas on both <br /> transparent and opaque substrates.Craic Technologies <br /> microspectrophotometers equipped with Craic FilmPro meets those needs" <br /> says Paul Martin, President.<br> <br> The complete Craic Technologies <br /> microspot film thickness solution combines an advanced <br /> microspectrophotometer with the sophisticated Craic FilmPro software. <br /> This software is a plug-in module to Craic Technologies Lambdafire <br /> instrument control software.&nbsp;<br> <br> It enables the user to measure film thickness by either transmission or reflectance of many types of materials and substrates.&nbsp;<br> <br><br /> Due to the flexibility of the Craic Technologies design, sampling areas<br /> can range from over 100 microns across to less than a micron. Designed <br /> for both research and the production environment, it incorporates a <br /> number of easily modified processing recipes, the ability to create new <br /> film recipes and sophisticated tools for analysing data.<br> <br> With <br /> the addition of spectral mapping from Craic Technologies, the firm says <br /> film thickness maps of entire devices can be created.<br>
