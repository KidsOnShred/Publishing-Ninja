<div>{Media2}</div>LY'ON Superchargers, Inc., a rapidly-growing Quebec, Canada-based manufacturer of next generation rechargeable energy storage solutions for commercial applications with a satellite office in Hong Kong, has announced that $20 million in new inward investment is to be provided by a private equity group that wishes to remain anonymous.<br><p></p><p>News of the investment follows the company's recent announcement of its plan to increase capacity at its main site in Pointe Claire, Quebec.</p><p>The investment will be used to scale manufacturing, research &amp; development and further development activities at the Hong Kong office for the company's leading energy storage technology products. It will also be used to enable LY'ON Superchargers to qualify for Chinese governmental incentives targeted at foreign corporations establishing manufacturing facilities on the mainland.</p><p>{Media3}<br></p><p>"This investment is a resounding vote of confidence in the path we've decided to follow in our effort to rise to the challenge of increased competition within the energy storage solutions industry. It is our firm belief that, upon completion of the capacity upgrades at Pointe Claire, we will have a state-of-the-art facility capable of producing 300 megawatt hours (MWh) of lithium-ion cells annually," said President of Lyon Superchargers, Andrew Richardson.</p><p>LY'ON Superchargers, which is nearing the conclusion of negotiations to supply power cells to a leading hybrid bus company in South East Asia, says it is keen to build a manufacturing facility in China, which it believes will enable it to compete with local competitors on price.</p><div><br> <img src="http://www.powerelectronicsworld.net/magazine/images/2013_issue_i/657704860_5_200_728x90.gif" alt="" align="none"><br> </div><br>Two-Switch-Forward IC Brings Component Count Down<p></p>Power Integrations, a supplier of high-voltage integrated circuits has announced the HiperTFS-2 family of ICs, combining two-switch-forward and flyback power-supply controller ICs with integrated high-voltage MOSFETs.<br><p>The company maintains this high level of integration saves more than 20 components, resulting in a smaller form factor and higher power density. The main converter provides a selectable switching frequency between 66 kHz and 132 kHz, which reduces system cost by enabling the use of very small magnetics.</p><p>HiperTFS-2 ICs enable efficiencies of more than 90% at full load. They also provide 175% peak power, a requirement of next-gen Intel CPUs. This single-chip implementation of a two-switch-forward main (66/132 kHz) and flyback (132 kHz) standby power supply delivers up to 364 W total output power (586 W peak) in a compact, two-row eSIP power package. Safety features include under voltage, overvoltage, over-temperature, over current and short-circuit protection. A transformer-reset control function prevents saturation under all conditions.</p><p>Comments Chris Lee, product marketing manager at Power Integrations: "HiperTFS-2 ICs enable power supply miniaturization in applications including 80 PLUS Bronze and 80 PLUS Silver PCs, gaming-console adapters and industrial products. The inclusion of the high-side MOSFET driver allows designers to eliminate the pulse transformer and many other supporting components, simplifying design and reducing the size (and cost) of the magnetics."</p>
