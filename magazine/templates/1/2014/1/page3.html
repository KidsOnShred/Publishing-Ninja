<h2>Toyota chooses Advantest's T2000 for Power Device Testing</h2>
<p>Semiconductor test equipment supplier Advantest Corporation has installed its T2000 Integrated Power Device Test Solution (IPS) at Toyota Motor Corporation for evaluating and mass-producing integrated power ICs used in next-generation hybrid cars.</p>

<p>Today's vehicles rely on semiconductors for engine control, navigation and an increasing number of other functions, causing the number of ICs used in vehicles to grow rapidly. With its mission of "creating ever-better cars," Toyota has been searching for a high-quality semiconductor test solution to ensure that its vehicle-mounted ICs have the increased reliability and expanded productivity that the car maker needs.</p>

<p>Toyota selected the T2000 IPS unit as an essential test system to enhance the safety and reliability of vehicle-mounted devices. Advantest's test solution demonstrated the flexibility, high performance and functionality to meet Toyota's quality requirements for both current and next-generation semiconductor devices.</p>

<p>The T2000 IPS is an optimal test solution for automotive devices, power-management ICs and power-switching devices. It can test an industry-leading number of devices in parallel by integrating various measurement resources in a single module and minimizing peripheral circuits.</p>

<p>This dramatically reduces waiting time compared to existing systems. In addition, the T2000 IPS includes all necessary elements - such as the T2000 platform's improved reliability, measurement accuracy and high-voltage support - in a single high-level test system.</p>

<p>"Our high-accuracy integrated power IC measurement architecture and the low cost of test achieved by our highly parallel operation are greatly valued by Toyota, the world's leading automotive company," says Satoru Nagumo, executive vice president of Advantest Corporation.</p>
