<br /> <br /> <p>In this<br /> week’s Nature Communications imec presents the development of fullerene-free<br /> organic photovoltaic (OPV) multilayer stacks achieving a record conversion<br /> efficiency of 8.4 percent. This breakthrough achievement is an important step<br /> to bring organic photovoltaic cells to a higher level in the competitive<br /> thin-film photovoltaics marketplace.</p><br /> <br /> <p>Organic<br /> solar cells are an interesting thin-film photovoltaic technology due to their<br /> compatibility with flexible substrates and tunable absorption window. Although<br /> the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has increased rapidly in<br /> the last decade, further enhancements are needed to make the production of<br /> organic photovoltaics more easily scalable into industrial production<br /> processes. Imec’s organic solar cells with record 8.4 percent power conversion<br /> efficiency were realized by introducing two innovations. Firstly, the<br /> implementation of fullerene-free acceptor materials resulted in high<br /> open-circuit voltages and useful absorption spectra in the visible. Secondly,<br /> high short-circuit currents were achieved by developing a multilayer device<br /> structure of three active semiconductor layers with complementary absorption<br /> spectra, and an efficient exciton harvesting mechanism.<br /> <br /> </p><p>Fullerenes<br /> are the dominant acceptor materials in current OPV cells due to their ability<br /> to accept stable electrons and their high electron mobility. However, the small<br /> absorption overlap with the solar spectrum limits the photocurrent generation<br /> in fullerene acceptors, and their deep energy level for electron conduction<br /> limits the open-circuit voltage. Imec implemented two fullerene-free materials<br /> as acceptor, increasing open-circuit voltages compared to OPV cells with<br /> fullerene acceptors.<br /> <br /> </p>
