The company will provide the consortium with its wire bonding equipment and ongoing process knowledge with respect to thin and heavy wire wedge bonding, ribbon bonding and a variety of metallisation processes and materials.</p><a target="" title="" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/" style="color: rgb(46, 64, 74); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);">President Obama's US manufacturing initiatives</a><a target="" title="" href="http://www.ncsu.edu/power" style="color: rgb(46, 64, 74); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);">Next Generation Power Electronic Manufacturing Institute</a><a target="" title="" href="http://www.energy.gov/" style="color: rgb(46, 64, 74); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);">Wide bandgap semiconductor technology</a><a target="" title="" href="http://www.hesse-mechatronics.com/" style="color: rgb(46, 64, 74); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);">Hesse Mechatronics</a><a target="" title="" href="http://www.wirebonddemo.com/" style="color: rgb(46, 64, 74); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);">To see wire bonding in action</a>
