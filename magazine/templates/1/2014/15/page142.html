 <div class="row"></div><p>IXYS Corporation, a manufacturer of power semiconductors and integrated circuits for energy efficiency, power management, and motor control applications, has announced a new IGBT product line, the 900V XPT IGBTs. </p> <p>The current ratings range from 20A to 310A. </p> <p>Designed especially for hard-switching applications, these new devices are able to achieve an optimal balance between the turn-off energy loss and on-state voltage. Able to support switching frequencies up to 50 kHz, they allow designers to use smaller and lighter components in their systems.</p> <p>Manufactured using the proprietary IXYS XPT technology, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation (GenX3) IGBT process, the devices are claimed to exhibit reduced thermal resistance, low tail current, low energy loss, and high-speed switching capability. </p> <p>In addition to being avalanche rated, they have square Reverse Bias Safe Operating Areas (RBSOA) up to the breakdown voltage of 900V - a necessary ruggedness in snubberless hard-switching applications.</p> <p>The optional co-packed diodes in Sonic-FRD or HiPerFRED Technology are optimised to reduce turn-off losses and suppress ringing oscillations, thereby producing smooth switching waveforms and significantly lowering electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the system. </p> <p>What's more, due to the soft recovery characteristics of the diodes, the IGBTs can be switched on at very high rates of change in current (di/dt), even in low current and temperature conditions. Other advantages include low gate charge and a positive temperature coefficient of the on-state voltage, translating into lower gate drive requirements and multiple device paralleling capability.</p> <p>Among other applications, these new IGBTs are well suited for high frequency power inverters, solar inverters, UPS, SMPS, motor drives, power factor correction circuits, battery chargers, AC switches, solid state relays, welding machines, lighting control, forklifts, E-bikes, EVs, and HEVs.</p> <p>The new 900V XPT IGBTs are available in the following standard packages: TO-220, TO-247, PLUS247, TO-252, TO-263, TO-264, TO-268, and SOT-227. Some example part numbers include IXYA8N90C3D1, IXYH24N90C3, IXYN80N90C3H1 and IXYK140N90C3, with collector current ratings of 20A, 44A, 115A, and 310A, respectively.</p>
