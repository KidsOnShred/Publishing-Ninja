<div>It’s not just internal users who demand constant access to data. Many organizations place a large percentage of&nbsp;their data in customer- and partner-facing line-of business applications. As a result, when a server goes down, it&nbsp;may not affect just your organization, but customer and partner organizations as well, with the potential result of&nbsp;both lost revenue and a diminished reputation.</div><div></div><div></div><div><p>Massive increases in the volume of data being stored have caused backup windows to lengthen, often to the point&nbsp;where even the most efficiently organized backup window impinges on the beginning of a new day’s business&nbsp;operations. For companies with world-wide operations, even a two-hour backup window can cause trouble on the&nbsp;other side of the globe when clients or internal users are in the midst of their workdays. And when it’s time to carry&nbsp;out a recovery, uncertainties abound among IT administrators concerning how well their data protection solution will perform, particularly if they depend on tapes, with their inherently higher failure rates and higher costs.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div><i>It’s time to reconsider a fresh backup and recovery strategy, one that is faster, more agile,&nbsp;and easier to manage than ever before.</i></div><div><i></i></div><div></div><div><p>Three major issues are driving backup/recovery and storage management vendors to dramatically re-tool the&nbsp;products they sell:</p></div><div></div><div></div><div>• Managing data and systems costs money, more than you might expect if they are not managed efficiently.&nbsp;</div><div>• Speed no longer applies just to backups. Recoveries, completed in minutes rather than hours, are critical to&nbsp;getting back to business.&nbsp;</div><div>• Compliance requirements have rewritten the way companies do business.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><p>Backup and recovery products must address these issues without reducing productivity or increasing the cost&nbsp;of doing business. There are many well-known solutions that can back up an organization’s digital assets&nbsp;successfully, with moderate to high levels of automation. Recoveries, on the other hand, are still mostly manual&nbsp;processes that can take hours to complete, threatening most companies’ ability to set more stringent recovery&nbsp;time objectives (RTO); this will include remote sites that aren’t staffed by IT professionals. Finally, rapid&nbsp;increases in the volume of data being backed up are driving storage management costs out of sight.&nbsp;</p></div><div></div><div></div><div><p><b>What is Needed to Address these Problems?</b></p></div><div><b></b></div><div></div><div><p>Analysts and customers substantially agree that disk imaging technology, thoughtfully applied and properly&nbsp;integrated, can drive down the cost of protecting data, enable faster backups and recoveries and meet a company’s&nbsp;reporting needs. An ideal solution should include:&nbsp;</p></div><div></div><div></div><div>• Fast, smaller backups that are easy to organize, schedule and manage&nbsp;</div><div>• Guaranteed recoveries that anyone can carry out without training&nbsp;</div><div>• Scalable technology that works as well in a huge IT shop as it does in a remote office&nbsp;</div><div>• Data deduplication to dramatically cut the costs associated with disk storage in large organizations&nbsp;</div><div>• Rapid migrations among both physical and virtual servers&nbsp;</div><div>• Deployments that dispense with traditional system ‘builds’&nbsp;</div><div>• Risk-free software and hardware upgrades</div>
