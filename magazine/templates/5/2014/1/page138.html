<p>Failures that used to take a server down for a day or more were frustrating a few years ago, but today they can translate into a direct loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost business and, further, tarnish reputations. </p> <p><img src="http://www.acronis.com/sites/default/files/styles/floated_image_small/public/multilingual/anydata_technology_0.png?itok=UESPC3VV">In today’s shared computing environment, traditional tape backup and recovery methods actually stand in the way of “Get it back NOW” demands on IT service continuity. Failures that used to take a server down for a day or more were frustrating a few years ago, but today they can translate into a direct loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars and limit your competitiveness. At the same time, everyday IT practices like migrations, hardware and software upgrades must be managed without disrupting user productivity. </p> <p><strong>Non-Negotiable Requirements.</strong></p> <p>Businesses large and small have three non-negotiable requirements of their backup and recovery solution. First, backup windows can no longer interrupt a company’s ability to conduct business. Second, when disaster strikes, recoveries must be completed quickly enough at both the server and workstation level to ensure service continuity. Third, its cost has to fit comfortably within increasingly tight budget allocations.</p> <p>Disk imaging products must be designed to meet all three of these requirements, addressing issues of cost, speed and various regulatory requirements. WHITE PAPER</p> <p>The advantages of disk imaging. When implemented properly, an image-based backup and recovery system: </p> <p>• lowers overall costs of managing data and systems,</p> <p>• creates a much faster response mechanism to reduce backup times and recoveries, and</p> <p>• simplifies an organization’s ability to meet regulatory and financial reporting needs </p> <p>All of these advances have a further bottom-line benefit: they lift and protect a company’s reputation and enhance its ability to do business successfully.Disk imaging is proven to be the best path to take when you compare solutions for reducing downtime. It offers a faster recovery time than archiving or file-level solutions (either tape or disk), and delivers a more affordable alternative to true continuous data protection (CDP) and replication technologies. Disk imaging technology also meets rapid recovery time (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) without additional hardware investments and it makes it much easier to protect and present data needed to meet regulatory and financial reporting requirements. </p> <p>However, disk imaging is not just for backup and recovery. Just as critical are all the actions you take every day, such as migrations, bare metal restores, IT center moves, deployments and more. </p> <p>An imaging-based solution, combined with strong centralized monitoring and automated management, meets today’s and tomorrow’s data protection needs.</p>
